The strength of each bid is determined by experience, internal cues, and external cues, and the basal ganglia only allow the strongest bids to express themselves. This process occurs beyond our conscious awareness—we only become aware of bids after they’re selected.28 This is consistent with Daniel Kahneman’s idea (discussed in the introduction) that most of what happens in the brain, including many decision-making processes, is nonconscious.",

Even effort barriers as small as having to open a cabinet, twist off a lid, peel an orange, or shell nuts can make the difference between eating the right amount and overeating. Keeping easy, tempting foods in plain sight, such as an open bag of chips or bowl of candy, creates a situation that is simply too tempting for the parts of our brains that are constantly on the lookout for a good deal.",

Fix your food environment Tempting food cues in your personal environment are powerful drivers of overeating due to their impact on brain areas that govern motivation and economic choice.

Don’t give yourself the option to eat these foods, and you’ll find that you crave them less.",

For example, if you have to peel an orange to eat it, you probably won’t go for it unless you’re genuinely hungry. The same goes for nuts in their shells. Perhaps the most stringent effort barrier is to limit the food in your kitchen to items you’d have to cook or reheat to eat. Chances are, if you have to cook something, you won’t eat it between meals unless you really need it.",

These are foods that have a lower calorie density, higher protein and/or fiber content, and a moderate level of palatability. This tends to include simple foods that are closer to their natural state, such as fresh fruit, vegetables, potatoes, fresh meats, seafood, eggs, yogurt, whole grains, beans, and lentils.",

We don’t know as much about how to satisfy the lipostat, and we’ll need more research to get a clearer view, but there is suggestive evidence that eating more protein and limiting highly rewarding foods can help. Regular physical activity, restorative sleep, and stress management may also support a leaner adiposity set point, facilitating weight loss and maintenance.",

Beware of food reward The brain values foods that contain calorie-dense combinations of fat, sugar, starch, protein, salt, and other elements, and it sets your motivation to eat those foods accordingly. This motivation is partially independent of hunger, such that it’s easy to blow past satiety signals if you’re eating something you love—think ice cream, brownies, french fries, chocolate, and bacon. These foods are a lot more rewarding than anything our distant ancestors ate, and they can powerfully drive cravings, overeating, and eventually, deeply ingrained unhealthy eating habits. When we eat simple foods that are less dense in calories and closer to their natural states, they’re still enjoyable but they don’t have that intensely rewarding edge that drives us to overdo it. These include things like fruit, vegetables, potatoes, beans, oatmeal,",

Choosing unsalted nuts reduces their reward value to a reasonable level.

Restorative sleep is an important cue for the nonconscious brain that has a major impact on performance and eating behavior—even if we aren’t directly aware of it. The first step toward restorative sleep is simply to spend enough time in bed. This may be all it takes for many people to be well rested. For people who have trouble sleeping, it helps to make sure your room is completely dark at night, allow your room to cool down in the evening if possible, and only use your bed for sleeping and sex.",

First, it increases the number of calories you use, making it less likely you’ll overeat. Studies show that when people with excess weight exercise regularly, their calorie intake tends to go up, but usually not enough to compensate for the calories they burn (although this does vary by individual). Second, physical activity may also help maintain the lipostat in the brain, encouraging a naturally lower level of adiposity in the long run. Our distant ancestors had a word for exercise: life. Movement has always been a key part of our species’ daily activity, and our bodies require it to function properly. It’s a fundamental ingredient for good health, physical and cognitive performance, emotional health, and healthy aging. As such, it’s an essential part of a healthy lifestyle, whether or not your goal is weight management.",

I think commuting on foot or by bicycle is a great way to build physical activity into your daily life in a time-efficient way. It may not be an option for everyone, but it is for many more people than may realize it. If your commute is too long to do by bike, try parking a few miles away from work and walking, jogging, or biking the rest of the way. You might find that you enjoy it. Sports like basketball and tennis are a fun, social way to be active.",

Manage stress The threat response system evolved to protect us, but sometimes in the modern world it can undermine our quality of life and our best intentions to eat the right amount of food. I’ll outline five actions you can take to identify the problem and manage stress eating by giving your threat response system the right cues. The first action is simply to identify whether or not you’re a stress eater. If you are, then you probably already know it. The second action is to identify the stressor(s)—particularly chronic stressors you don’t feel you can control. These often include work stress, money, health problems, prolonged caregiving, interpersonal conflict, and/or a lack of social support.",
