## FOREWORD

 > my experience has shown me that the people who are exceptionally good in business aren’t so because of what they know but because of their insatiable need to know more .

 > The problem with most failing businesses I’ve encountered is not that their owners don’t know enough about finance, marketing, management, and operations—they don’t, but those things are easy enough to learn—but that they spend their time and energy defending what they think they know. The greatest businesspeople I’ve met are determined to get it right no matter what the cost.

## THE ENTREPRENEURIAL MYTH

 > That Fatal Assumption is: if you understand the technical work of a business, you understand a business that does that technical work . And the reason it’s fatal is that it just isn’t true. In fact, it’s the root cause of most small business failures! The technical work of a business and a business that does that technical work are two totally different things! But the technician who starts a business fails to see this. To the technician suffering from an Entrepreneurial Seizure, a business is not a business but a place to go to work.

## THE ENTREPRENEUR, THE MANAGER, AND THE TECHNICIAN

 > But it’s a three-way battle between The Entrepreneur, The Manager, and The Technician.

 > The entrepreneurial personality turns the most trivial condition into an exceptional opportunity. The Entrepreneur is the visionary in us. The dreamer. The energy behind every human activity.

 > The Entrepreneur lives in the future, never in the past, rarely in the present. He’s happiest when left free to construct images of “what-if” and “if-when.”
