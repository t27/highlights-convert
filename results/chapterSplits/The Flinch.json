It’s why you can’t quit your job or be the person you want to be—you can’t see the flinch in yourself. The flinch is why you don’t do the work that matters, and why you won’t make the hard decisions.",

It’s simple, and it works if what you want is to understand your environment. This curiosity is why kids touch burners. They want to know how things work. They’re interested, and they’re not spoiled by the flinch. They just do it. They test their environment, and stop when it hurts. The scars they get are medals they’ve won, not deformities they need to hide.",

Over a lifetime, those who listen too much build a habit of trust and conformity. Unfortunately, as time goes on, that habit becomes unbreakable. This is dangerous.",

The less these situations provoke you, the more you can focus. Then, once you’re ready, listen to yourself. When you’re facing the flinch, you use words like “stupid,” “safe,” “pointless,” or anything else that is soft, judgmental, and blurry. The flinch thrives on making risks look worse than they are. So look for those words, act anyway, and judge from hindsight instead. You’ll know you’ve opened the right door when you feel a strong, irresistible impulse to do something else, anything else.
