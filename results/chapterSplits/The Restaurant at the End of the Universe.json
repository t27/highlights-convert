          "content": "For instance, a race of hyperintelligent pandimensional beings once built themselves a gigantic supercomputer called Deep Thought to calculate once and for all the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything. For seven and a half million years, Deep Thought computed and calculated, and in the end announced that the answer was in fact Forty-two‚Äîand so another, even bigger, computer had to be built to find out what the actual question was. And this computer, which was called the Earth, was so large that it was frequently mistaken for a planet‚Äîespecially by the strange apelike beings who roamed its surface, totally unaware that they were simply part of a gigantic computer program. And this is very odd, because without that fairly simple and obvious piece of knowledge, nothing that ever happened on the Earth could possibly make the slightest bit of sense. Sadly, however, just before the critical moment of read-out, the Earth was unexpectedly demolished by the Vogons to make way‚Äîso they claimed‚Äîfor a new hyperspace bypass, and so all hope of discovering a meaning for life was lost for ever. Or so it would seem.",

The motto stands‚Äîor rather stood‚Äîin three-mile-high illuminated letters near the Complaints Department spaceport on Eadrax. Unfortunately its weight was such that shortly after it was erected, the ground beneath the letters caved in and they dropped for nearly half their length through the offices of many talented young Complaints executives‚Äînow deceased. The protruding upper halves of the letters now appear, in the local language, to read ‚ÄúGo stick your head in a pig,‚Äù and are no longer illuminated, except at times of special celebration.",

          "content": "The Restaurant at the End of the Universe is one of the most extraordinary ventures in the entire history of catering. It is built on the fragmented remains of an eventually ruined planet which is (wioll haven be) enclosed in a vast time bubble and projected forward in time to the precise moment of the End of the Universe. This is, many would say, impossible. In it, guests take (willan on-take) their places at table and eat (willan on-eat) sumptuous meals while watching (willing watchen) the whole of creation explode around them. This, many would say, is equally impossible. You can arrive (mayan arrivan on-when) for any sitting you like without prior (late fore-when) reservation because you can book retrospectively, as it were when you return to your own time (you can have on-book haventa forewhen presooning returningwenta retrohome). This is, many would now insist, absolutely impossible. At the Restaurant you can meet and dine with (mayan meetan con with dinan on when) a fascinating cross-section of the entire population of space and time. This, it can be explained patiently, is also impossible. You can visit it as many times as you like (mayan onvisit re-onvisiling‚Ä¶ and so on‚Äîfor further tense correction consult Dr. Streetmentioner‚Äôs book) and be sure of never meeting yourself, because of the embarrassment this usually causes. This, even if the rest were true, which it isn‚Äôt, is patently impossible, say the doubters. All you have to do is deposit one penny in a savings account in your own era, and when you arrive at the End of Time the operation of compound interest means that the fabulous cost of your meal has been paid for. This, many claim, is not merely impossible but clearly insane, which is why the advertising executives of the star system of Bastablon came up with this slogan: ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve done six impossible things this morning, why not round it off with breakfast at Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe?‚Äù",

For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question, ‚ÄúHow can we eat?‚Äù, the second by the question, ‚ÄúWhy do we eat?‚Äù and the third by the question, ‚ÄúWhere shall we have lunch?‚Äù The Menu goes on to suggest that Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, would be a very agreeable and sophisticated answer to that third question.",
