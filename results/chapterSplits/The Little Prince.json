When they hear that you have made a new friend, they ask the most unimportant questions. They never say, ‘What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies?’ Instead, they ask: ‘How old is he? How many brothers has he? What is his weight? Does his father make much money?’ From these numbers alone they think they have learned everything about him. For instance, if you were to say to the grown-ups: ‘I saw a beautiful brick house with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof,’ they would be confused. But if you say, ‘I saw a house worth a million dollars,’ they would remark, ‘What a pretty house!’",

It was on the fourth morning that I learnt of this fact, when you said to me: ‘I do love sunsets. Let us go and watch one now.’ ‘But we must wait.’ ‘Wait? For what?’ ‘Wait until it is time for sunset.’ You seemed puzzled at first. Then you laughed and said: ‘I keep forgetting that I’m not at home!’ He had clearly forgotten. It is a known fact that when it is noontime in America, the sun is setting over France. If you could swiftly zip through the air to France, you would be able to watch the sun go down. Unfortunately, France is too far away. But on your planet, my little prince, all you need to do is revolve your chair a little and watch night fall. ‘I watched forty-four sunsets one day!’ ‘You know,’ you added sometime later, ‘when people are sad, they watch sunsets.’ ‘Were you sad too, my little friend,’ I asked, ‘the day you watched the forty-four sunsets?’ But there was no reply.",

But, he was also a kind man, so his orders were always reasonable. ‘If I demand that a general,’ he would frequently say, ‘should transform into a sea bird and if the general is unable to do so, that would not be his fault. It would be mine.’",

But you cannot pluck the stars.’ ‘No. But I can put them in the bank.’ ‘Whatever do you mean?’ ‘What it means is that, I write the number of my stars on a little piece of paper and then I put this paper in a drawer and lock it with a key.’ ‘And that is all?’ ‘That is enough,’ said the businessman. ‘This is entertaining,’ thought the little prince. ‘It is rather poetic in fact. But it’s of no great consequence.’ On important matters, the little prince’s ideas were completely different from those of the grown-ups. ‘I own a flower,’ he continued, ‘that I water every day. I own three volcanoes, which I clean out every week. I also clean out the extinct one because one never knows. It is of some use to my volcanoes and to my flower that I own them. But you are of no use to the stars.’ The businessman opened his mouth, but there came no answer. So the little prince went away. ‘Grown-ups are quite astonishing,’ he said to himself as he continued on his travels.",

But if you tame me, my life will light up. I’ll recognize your footsteps from all the others. While other’s footfalls drive me underground, yours will draw me out like music. Look there! Do you see the wheat fields? I do not eat bread. Wheat is of no use to me. They remind me of nothing. And that is sad. But your hair is the colour of gold. Imagine how it will be when you have tamed me! I will see the golden wheat and think of you. And the wind whispering through the wheat stalks will make me happy.’ The fox paused and looked longingly at the little prince. ‘Please… tame me!’ he said. ‘I would really like to,’ the little prince replied. ‘But I have very little time. I have to look for friends and there is still so much to understand.’",

And it will be clear to you that yours is unique. Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will give you for a gift a secret.’",
