Conceivably, you could shut down all new development efforts and let go of most of your staff, and the subscription dollars would keep coming in.

Get comfortable with the odds, or don’t roll the dice. The venture business is about outliers. If you want to raise money, or if you’re joining a startup that’s planning to raise money (or already has), you have to understand these odds and this risk model or you’ll be an unwitting pawn in a game where the deck’s stacked against you. If your startup raises VC, but you’re unwilling to do high-risk things that could kill your business nine out of ten times but might make you a unicorn, you’re not aligned with the venture model. That misalignment can mean losing your job and your company, or getting in a nasty stalemate with your board of directors.",

I diligently followed up every time, and talked to at least two or three CEOs funded by a dozen or so venture firms. Of those, the majority did have good, though not always glowingly positive, things to say. And even though it was my first time speaking to these CEOs, many were happy to give me an honest and surprisingly cold or even directly negative feedback about their investors. I found this disconnect between the confidence of the partner and the honesty of the founder/CEO valuable and refreshing. If you go down the venture funding path, make sure you do the same. And for those of you who get funded or who already are, please carry on this tradition of putting your fellow entrepreneurs first. It helps make the land-mine-laden game of startup investment a little less dangerous and a little more camaraderie-filled.",

People must be predisposed to holding them. Executives often ask me, “How do we get people to share our core values?” You don’t. Instead, the task is to find people who are already predisposed to sharing your core values.

I thought I was alone, a frail, former CEO who’d lost his job because he couldn’t handle the stress and pressure and caved in to depression. But those hands in the air made me realize I was far from alone—I was, in fact, part of an overwhelming majority, at least among this group. That mental transition from loneliness and shame to a peer among equals forever changed the way I thought about depression and the stigma around mental disorders. I am not alone. Neither are you.",

This holds equally true for your startup as for your emotional health. Because, as much as we wish we could, we never have full control over outcomes. We own our behavior, and some of the time (hopefully often), the right behaviors lead to the outcomes we want. Recognizing this is crucial, because many people and organizations reward outcomes rather than behavior. That can lead to punishing good behaviors if the outcome isn’t the desired one, even if the forces were outside our control. And it can lead to reinforcing bad behaviors simply because they led to a good outcome",

The “I was depressed but then I installed this great mindfulness app and now I’m teaching my therapist how to live a happy life” story goes right up there with “I was hooked on In-N-Out burgers and Pixy Stix; couldn’t program my way out of a Raspberry Pi. But I switched all my meals to Soylent and now I’m a lean, mean, code-crushin’ machine.” When you invest in a behavior, invest in *just* the behavior. Assess it based on its strengths and weaknesses, its costs and returns. Anti-work night didn’t solve my depression, so I stopped doing it for more than six months. But when I had the revelation that behaviors trump outcomes, I brought it back. I did the same with physical therapy and exercise. I skipped the mindfulness app, the meditation, the acupuncture, and the herbal medicines.",

Greater growth means higher valuations, the ability to attract better talent, the envy of your peers, the coveted press and prestige, the possibility to sell your company or your stock and become wealthy; all of it is dependent on growth as measured by the percentage of year-over-year revenue addition (at least, in the case of companies with revenue). That bias rapidly leads to thinking along lines like “Our core product is growing, but I bet we could grow even faster if we . . .” Filling in that blank is dangerous, because it’s almost always occupied by something that adds complexity and removes focus. Maybe it’s new features you believe could get you more growth, or a whole new product line, or the acquisition of another company, or a few R&D projects that could yield the next big thing.
