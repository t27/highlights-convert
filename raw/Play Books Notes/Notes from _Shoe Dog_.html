                                <p><em>college—­University of Oregon. Earned a master’s from a top business
                                        school—Stanford. Survived a yearlong hitch in the U.S. Army—Fort Lewis and Fort
                                        Eustis. My résumé said I was a learned, accomplished soldier, a
                                        twenty-four-year-old man in full . . . So why, I wondered, why do I still feel
                                        like a kid? Worse, like the same shy, pale, rail-thin kid I’d always been.
                                        Maybe because I still hadn’t experienced anything of life. Least of all its
                                        many temptations and excitements. I hadn’t smoked a cigarette, hadn’t tried a
                                        drug. I hadn’t broken a rule, let alone a law. The 1960s were just under way,
                                        the age of rebellion, and I was the only person in America who hadn’t yet
                                        rebelled. I couldn’t think of one time I’d cut loose, done the unexpected. I’d
                                        never even been with a girl. If I tended to dwell on all the things I wasn’t,
                                        the reason was simple. Money? Maybe. Wife? Kids? House? Sure, if I was lucky.
                                        These were the goals I was taught to aspire to, and part of me did aspire to
                                        them, instinctively. But deep down I was searching for something else,
                                        something more. I had an aching sense that our time is short, shorter than we
                                        ever know, short as a morning run, and I wanted mine to be meaningful. And
                                        purposeful. And creative. And impor­tant. Above all . . . different. I wanted
                                        to leave a mark on the world. I wanted to win. No, that’s not right. I simply
                                        didn’t want to lose.</em></p>

                                        hard. It’s painful. It’s risky. The rewards are few and far from guaranteed.
                                        When you run around an oval track, or down an empty road, you have no real
                                        destination. At least, none that can fully justify the effort. The act itself
                                        becomes the destination. It’s not just that there’s no finish line; it’s that
                                        you define the finish line. Whatever pleasures or gains you derive from the act
                                        of running, you must find them within. It’s all in how you frame it, how you
                                        sell it to yourself. Every runner knows this. You run and run, mile after mile,
                                        and you never quite know why. You tell yourself that you’re running toward some
                                        goal, chasing some rush, but really you run because the alternative, stopping,
                                        scares you to death.</em></p>

                                        I’d also covered one wall with my blue ribbons from track, the one thing in my
                                        life of which I was unabashedly proud. And so? “Blue Ribbon,” I blurted.
                                        “Gentlemen, I represent Blue Ribbon Sports of Portland, Oregon.” Mr. Miyazaki
                                        smiled. The other executives smiled. A murmur went around the table.
                                        Blueribbon, blueribbon, blueribbon. The executives folded their hands and fell
                                        silent again and resumed staring at me. “Well,” I began again, “gentlemen, the
                                        American shoe market is enormous. And largely untapped. If Onitsuka can
                                        penetrate that market, if Onitsuka can get its Tigers into American stores, and
                                        price them to undercut Adidas, which most American athletes now wear, it could
                                        be a hugely profitable venture.”</em></p>

                                        day after day. So Bowerman rigged the mailbox with explosives. Next time the
                                        trucker knocked it over—boom. When the smoke cleared, the trucker found his

                                        unable to sell encyclopedias, and I’d despised it to boot. I’d been slightly
                                        better at selling mutual funds, but I’d felt dead inside. So why was selling
                                        shoes so different? Because, I realized, it wasn’t selling. I believed in
                                        running. I believed that if people got out and ran a few miles every day, the
                                        world would be a better place, and I believed these shoes were better to run
                                        in. People, sensing my belief, wanted some of that belief for themselves.
                                        Belief, I decided. Belief is irresistible.</em></p>

                                        girlfriend fell away. Each night I’d sit with my family at dinner, moving my
                                        mother’s pot roast and vegetables around my plate. Then I’d sit with my father
                                        in the nook, staring glumly at the TV. “Buck,” my father said, “you look like
                                        someone hit you in the back of the head with a two-by-four. Snap out of it.”
                                        But I couldn’t. I kept going over my meeting at Onitsuka. The executives had
                                        shown me such kei. They’d bowed to me, and vice versa. I’d been straightforward
                                        with them, honest—for the most part. Sure, I hadn’t “technically” owned a
                                        “business” called “Blue Ribbon.” But that was splitting hairs. I owned one now,
                                        and it had single-­handedly brought Tigers to the West Coast, and it could sell
                                        Tigers ten times faster if Onitsuka gave me half a chance. Instead the company
                                        was going to cut me out? Throw me over for the fricking Marlboro Man? Come to

                                        running career at Oregon. I’d competed with, and against, men far better,
                                        faster, more physically gifted. Many were future Olympians. And yet I’d trained
                                        myself to forget this unhappy fact. People reflexively assume that competition
                                        is always a good thing, that it always brings out the best in people, but
                                        that’s only true of people who can forget the competition. The art of
                                        competing, I’d learned from track, was the art of forgetting, and I now
                                        reminded myself of that fact. You must forget your limits. You must forget your

                                        begging, “Not one more step!” And when it’s not possible to forget it, you must
                                        negotiate with it. I thought over all the races in which my mind wanted one
                                        thing, and my body wanted another, those laps in which I’d had to tell my body,
                                        “Yes, you raise some excellent points, but let’s keep going anyway . . .”
                                        Despite all my negotiations with that voice, the skill had never come
                                        naturally, and now I feared that I was out of practice. As the plane swooped
                                        down toward Haneda Airport I told myself that I’d need to summon the old skill
                                        quickly, or lose. I could not bear the thought of losing.</em></p>

                                        faithfully to Sarah.) And I always meant to answer Johnson’s letters. But
                                        before I got around to it there was always another one, waiting. Something
                                        about the sheer volume of his correspondence stopped me. Something about his
                                        neediness made me not want to encourage him. Many nights I’d sit down at the
                                        black Royal typewriter in my basement workshop, curl a piece of paper into the
                                        roller, and type, “Dear Jeff.” Then I’d draw a blank. I wouldn’t know where to

                                        other things, and the next day there’d be yet another letter from Johnson. Or
                                        two. Soon I’d be three letters behind, suffering from crippling writer’s block.
                                        I asked Jeanne to deal with the Johnson File. Fine, she said. Within a month
                                        she thrust the file at me, exasperated. “You’re not paying me enough,” she

                                        also never missed an opportunity to tell him the unvarnished truth. In one of
                                        my rare replies to his letters I put it flatly: “Though our growth has been
                                        good, I owe First National Bank of Oregon $11,000. . . . Cash flow is
                                        negative.” He wrote back immediately, asking if he could work for me full-time.

                                        first year, I was projecting sixteen thousand dollars in my second year, and
                                        according to my banker this was a very troubling trend. “A one hundred percent
                                        increase in sales is troubling ?” I asked. “Your rate of growth is too fast for
                                        your equity,” he said. “How can such a small company grow too fast? If a small
                                        company grows fast, it builds up its equity.” “It’s all the same principle,
                                        regardless of size,” he said. “Growth off your balance sheet is dangerous.”
                                        “Life is growth,” I said. “Business is growth. You grow or you die.” “That’s
                                        not how we see it.” “You might as well tell a runner in a race that he’s

                                        exactly as I pleased. I’d place another order with Onitsuka, double the size of
                                        the previous order, and show up at the bank all wide-eyed innocence, asking for
                                        a letter of credit to cover it. My banker would always be shocked. You want HOW

                                        full, I’d do it all over again. Place a mega order with Onitsuka, double the
                                        size of the previous order, then go to the bank in my best suit, an angelic

                                        twenty-six miles. So Johnson hired a local cobbler to graft rubber soles from a

                                        forwarded me the results and urged me to pass them along to Tiger. Bowerman had

                                <p><em>He said in a few terse words that this would not be possible. Onitsuka wanted
                                        for its U.S. distributor someone bigger, more established, a firm that could
                                        handle the workload. A firm with offices on the East Coast. “But, but,” I
                                        spluttered, “Blue Ribbon does have offices on the East Coast.” Kitami rocked
                                        back in his chair. “Oh?” “Yes,” I said, “we’re on the East Coast, the West
                                        Coast, and soon we may be in the Midwest. We can handle national distribution,
                                        no question.” I looked around the table. The grim faces were becoming less
                                        grim. “Well,” Kitami said, “this change things.” He assured me that they would
                                        give my proposal careful consideration. So. Hai. Meeting adjourned. I walked
                                        back to my hotel and spent a second night pacing. First thing the next morning
                                        I received a call summoning me back to Onitsuka, where Kitami awarded me
                                        exclusive distribution rights for the United States. He gave me a three-year
                                        contract. I tried to be nonchalant as I signed the papers and placed an order
                                        for five thousand more shoes, which would cost twenty thousand dollars I didn’t
                                        have. Kitami said he’d ship them to my East Coast office, which I also didn’t
                                        have. I promised to wire him the exact address.</em></p>
                                <p>It's ok to say a white lie, if you can make it true. So it isn't a lie anymore. Phil
                                    didn't have an east coast office but he still told them that he did, and it was
                                    enough to tip the decision in his favour. Unintuitive but true.</p>

                                        Grella, or sometimes Gorilla—had been the fastest runner in Oregon, and I had
                                        been the second-fastest, which meant four years of staring at Grelle’s back.
                                        Then Grelle and I both went to the University of Oregon, where his tyranny over
                                        me continued. By the time I graduated I hoped never again to see Grelle’s back.
                                        Years later, when Grelle won the 1,500 in Moscow’s Lenin Stadium, I was wearing
                                        an army uniform, sitting on a couch in the day room at Fort Lewis. I pumped my
                                        fist at the screen, proud of my fellow Oregonian, but I also died a little at
                                        the memory of the many times he’d bested me. Now I began to see Adidas as a

                                        and late nights and all weekends and vacations at Blue Ribbon. No friends, no
                                        exercise, no social life—and wholly content. My life was out of balance, sure,
                                        but I didn’t care. In fact, I wanted even more imbalance. Or a different kind
                                        of imbalance. I wanted to dedicate every minute of every day to Blue Ribbon.
                                        I’d never been a multitasker, and I didn’t see any reason to start now. I
                                        wanted to be present, always. I wanted to focus constantly on the one task that
                                        really mattered. If my life was to be all work and no play, I wanted my work to
                                        be play. I wanted to quit Price Waterhouse. Not that I hated it; it just wasn’t
                                        me. I wanted what everyone wants. To be me, full-time. But it wasn’t possible.
                                        Blue Ribbon simply couldn’t support me. Though the company was on track to
                                        double sales for a fifth straight year, it still couldn’t justify a salary for
                                        its cofounder. So I decided to I applied to Portland State University, and got
                                        a job as an assistant professor, at seven hundred dollars a month.</em></p>

                                        nervous laughter, one portentous silence. I remember one long moment of eye
                                        contact that kept me awake that night. Then it happened. On a cold afternoon in

                                        inside I saw . . . a stack of checks? All her paychecks—uncashed. This wasn’t a

                                        brothers who despised each other—had chased each other like Keystone Kops
                                        around the Olympic ­Village, jockeying for all the athletes. Huge sums of cash,
                                        often stuffed in running shoes or manila envelopes, were passed around. One of
                                        Puma’s sales reps even got thrown in jail. (There were rumors that Adidas had
                                        framed him.) He was married to a female sprinter, and Bowerman joked that he’d
                                        only married her to secure her endorsement. Worse, it didn’t stop at mere
                                        payouts. Puma had smuggled truckloads of shoes into Mexico City, while Adidas
                                        cleverly managed to evade Mexico’s stiff import tariffs. I heard through the
                                        grapevine they did it by making a nominal number of shoes at a factory in
                                        Guadalajara. Bowerman and I didn’t feel morally offended; we felt left out.
                                        Blue Ribbon had no money for payouts, and therefore no presence at the Games.</em></p>

                                        may seem somewhat unethical to you, but the spy system is ingrained and
                                        completely accepted in Japanese business circles. They actually have schools

                                        new operations manager, Woodell, to Los Angeles, to patch things up. Woodell
                                        took Bork to lunch and tried to explain that I wasn’t sleeping much, with a new
                                        baby and all. Also, Woodell told him, I was feeling tremendous stress after the
                                        visit from Kitami and Mr. Onitsuka. Woodell joked about my unique management
                                        style, telling Bork that everyone bitched about it, everyone pulled their hair
                                        out about my nonresponses to their memos and letters. In all Woodell spent a
                                        few days with Bork, smoothing his feathers, going over the operation. He
                                        discovered that Bork was stressed, too. Though the retail store was thriving,
                                        the back room, which had basically become our national warehouse, was in
                                        shambles. Boxes everywhere, invoices and papers stacked to the ceiling. Bork
                                        couldn’t keep pace. When Woodell returned he gave me the picture. “I think
                                        Bork’s back in the fold,” he said, “but we need to relieve him of that
                                        warehouse. We need to transfer all warehouse operations up here.” Moreover, he
                                        added, we needed to hire Woodell’s mother to run it. She’d worked for years in
                                        the warehouse at Jantzen, the legendary Oregon outfitter, so it wasn’t
                                        nepotism, he said. Ma Woodell was perfect for the job. I wasn’t sure I cared.
                                        If Woodell was good with it, I was good with it. Plus, the way I saw it: The
                                        more Woodells the better.</em></p>

                                        shower and a quick dinner, alone. (Penny and Matthew ate around four.) I’d

                                        Fleetingly. “We’re out of time,” I said. “Nike. Falcon. Or Dimension Six.”

                                        First, Johnson had pointed out that seemingly all iconic brands—Clorox,
                                        Kleenex, Xerox—have short names. Two syllables or less. And they always have a
                                        strong sound in the name, a letter like “K” or “X,” that sticks in the mind.
                                        That all made sense. And that all described Nike. Also, I liked that Nike was
                                        the goddess of victory. What’s more important, I thought, than victory? I might
                                        have heard, in the far recesses of my mind, Churchill’s voice. You ask, What is
                                        our aim? I can answer in one word. It is victory. I might have recalled the
                                        victory medal awarded to all veterans of World War II, a bronze medallion with
                                        Athena Nike on the front, breaking a sword in two. I might have. Sometimes I
                                        believe that I did. But in the end I don’t really know what led me to my
                                        decision. Luck? Instinct? Some inner spirit? Yes. “What’d you decide?” Woodell
                                        asked me at the end of the day. “Nike,” I mumbled. “Hm,” he said. “Yeah, I
                                        know,” I said. “Maybe it’ll grow on us,” he said. Maybe.</em></p>

                                        cause. The stock is quasi because debenture holders are strongly encouraged,

                                        Shoe dogs were people who devoted themselves wholly to the making, selling,
                                        buying, or designing of shoes. Lifers used the phrase cheerfully to describe
                                        other lifers, men and women who had toiled so long and hard in the shoe trade,
                                        they thought and talked about nothing else. It was an all-consuming mania, a
                                        recognizable psychological disorder, to care so much about insoles and
                                        outsoles, linings and welts, rivets and vamps. But I understood. The average
                                        person takes seventy-­five hundred steps a day, 274 million steps over the
                                        course of a long life, the equivalent of six times around the globe—shoe dogs,
                                        it seemed to me, simply wanted to be part of that journey. Shoes were their way
                                        of connecting with humanity. What better way of connecting, shoe dogs thought,
                                        than by refining the hinge that joins each person to the world’s surface?</em></p>

                                        up straighter. “This is—the moment,” I said. “This is the moment we’ve been
                                        waiting for. Our moment. No more selling someone else’s brand. No more working
                                        for someone else. Onitsuka has been holding us down for years. Their late
                                        deliveries, their mixed-up orders, their refusal to hear and implement our
                                        design ideas—who among us isn’t sick of dealing with all that? It’s time we
                                        faced facts: If we’re going to succeed, or fail, we should do so on our own
                                        terms, with our own ideas—our own brand. We posted two million in sales last
                                        year . . . none of which had anything to do with Onitsuka. That number was a
                                        testament to our ingenuity and hard work. Let’s not look at this as a crisis.
                                        Let’s look at this as our liberation. Our Independence Day. “Yes, it’s going to
                                        be rough. I won’t lie to you. We’re definitely going to war, people. But we

                                        feel in my heart this is a war we can win. And if we win it, when we win it, I
                                        see great things for us on the other side of victory. We are still alive,
                                        people. We are still. Alive.” As I stopped speaking I could see a wave of

                                        and rehearsed, because I wanted Strasser, and I knew there would be pushback.
                                        He had before him a clear path to the very top of Cousin Houser’s firm, or any
                                        other firm he might choose. Without much effort he could become partner, secure
                                        a life of means, privilege, prestige. That was the known, and we were offering
                                        him The Unknown. So Hayes and I spent days role-playing, polishing our
                                        arguments and counterarguments, anticipating what objections Strasser might
                                        raise.</em></p>

                                        Nastase for ten thousand dollars, I said, and we were willing to offer his boy
                                        half that. The agent jumped at the deal. Before Connors could sign the papers,
                                        however, he left the country for Wimbledon. Then, against all odds, he won
                                        Wimbledon. In our shoes. Next, he came home and shocked the world by winning
                                        the U.S. Open. I was giddy. I phoned the agent and asked if Connors had signed
                                        those papers yet. We wanted to get started promoting him. “What papers?” the
                                        agent said. “Uh, the papers. We had a deal, remember?” “Yeah, I don’t remember

                                        that the demand out there was for $5 million? So I was forever pushing my
                                        conservative bankers to the brink, forcing them into a game of chicken. I’d
                                        order a number of shoes that seemed to them absurd, a number we’d need to
                                        stretch to pay for, and I’d always just barely pay for them, in the nick of
                                        time, and then just barely pay our other monthly bills, at the last minute,
                                        always doing just enough, and no more, to prevent the bankers from booting us.
                                        And then, at the end of the month, I’d empty our accounts to pay Nissho and
                                        start from zero again. To most observers this would’ve seemed a brazenly
                                        reckless, dangerous way of doing business, but I believed the demand for our
                                        shoes was always greater than our annual sales. Besides, eight of every ten
                                        orders were solid gold, guaranteed, thanks to our Futures program. Full speed

                                        this night, I had no answers. I got up, found a yellow legal pad, started
                                        making lists. But my mind kept drifting; when I looked down at the pad there
                                        were only doodles. Check marks, squiggles, lightning bolts. In the eerie glow

                                        Holland nodded. “Yes, that’s right, Mr. Ito.” “In that case,” Ito said, “Nissho

                                        Japanese for: Did I stutter? “Yes,” Ito said. “What is the number?” Holland
                                        wrote a number on his pad and slid the paper toward Ito, who glanced quickly
                                        down. “Yes,” Ito said. “That is what your people have already told my people.
                                        And so.” He opened his briefcase, removed an envelope, and slid it across the
                                        table at Holland. “Here is a check for the full amount.” “It will be deposited
                                        first thing in the morning,” Holland said. “It will be deposited first thing
                                        today!” Ito said. Holland stammered. “Okay, right, today.” The cohorts looked
                                        bewildered, terrified. Ito swiveled in his chair, took them all in with a
                                        subzero gaze. “There is one more thing,” he said. “I believe your bank has been
                                        negotiating in San Francisco to become one of Nissho’s banks?” “That’s right,”
                                        Holland said. “Ah. I must tell you that it will be a waste of your time to
                                        pursue those negotiations any further.” “Are you sure?” Holland asked. “I am
                                        quite sure.” The Ice Man cometh. I slid my eyes toward Hayes. I tried not to
                                        smile. I tried very hard. I failed. Then I looked right at Holland. It was all
                                        there in his unblinking eyes. He knew the bank had overplayed its hand. He knew
                                        the bank’s officers had overreacted. I could see, in that moment, there would
                                        be no more FBI investigation. He and the bank wanted this matter closed, over,
                                        done with. They’d treated a good customer shabbily, and they didn’t want to
                                        have to answer for their actions. We would never hear of them, or him, again. I
                                        looked at the suits on either side of Holland. “Gentlemen,” I said, standing.

                                        forward from the stress of the last three days. “Thank you,” I said to Ito.

                                <p><em>Going public would generate a ton of money in a flash. But it would also be
                                        highly perilous, because going public often meant losing control. It could mean
                                        working for someone else, suddenly being answerable to stockholders, hundreds
                                        or maybe thousands of strangers, many of whom would be large investment firms.
                                        Going public could turn us overnight into the thing we loathed, the thing we’d
                                        spent our lives running from. For me there was an added consideration, a
                                        semantic one. Defined by shyness, intensely private, I found that phrase itself
                                        off-­putting: going public. No thank you.</em></p>

                                        rejected by society, shortchanged by fate when looks and other natural graces
                                        were handed out. We’d each been forged by early failure. We’d each given
                                        ourselves to some quest, some attempt at validation or meaning, and fallen
                                        short. Hayes couldn’t become a partner because he was too fat. Johnson couldn’t
                                        cope in the so-called normal world of nine-to-five. Strasser was an insurance
                                        lawyer who hated insurance—and lawyers. Woodell lost all his youthful dreams in
                                        one fluke accident. I got cut from the baseball team. And I got my heart

                                        mainly about me. Was I doing right by the Buttfaces, giving them so little
                                        guidance? When they did well I’d shrug and deliver my highest praise: Not bad.
                                        When they erred I’d yell for a minute or two, then shake it off. None of the
                                        Buttfaces felt the least threatened by me—was that a good thing? Don’t tell
                                        people how to do things, tell them what to do and let them surprise you with
                                        their results. It was the right tack for Patton and his GIs. But did that make
                                        it right for a bunch of Buttfaces? I worried. Maybe I should be more hands-on.
                                        Maybe we should be more structured. But then I’d think: Whatever I’m doing, it
                                        must be working, because mutinies are few. In fact, ever since Bork, no one had
                                        thrown a genuine tantrum, about anything, not even what they were paid, which
                                        is unheard of in any company, big or small. The Buttfaces knew I wasn’t paying
                                        myself much, and they trusted that I was paying them what I could. Clearly the
                                        Buttfaces liked the culture I’d created. I trusted them, wholly, and didn’t
                                        look over their shoulders, and that bred a powerful two-way loyalty. My
                                        management style wouldn’t have worked for people who wanted to be guided, every
                                        step, but this group found it liberating, empowering. I let them be, let them
                                        do, let them make their own mistakes, because that’s how I’d always liked
                                        people to treat me.</em></p>

                                        problem for the moment. More important, it gave us the capacity to shift

                                        thought, speaks for itself, or it doesn’t. In the end, it’s only quality that
                                        counts. I couldn’t imagine that any ad campaign would ever prove me wrong or
                                        change my mind. Our advertising people, of course, told me I was wrong, wrong,
                                        a thousand percent wrong. But again and again I’d ask them: Can you say
                                        definitively that people are buying Nikes because of your ad? Can you show it
                                        to me in black-and-white numbers? Silence. No, they’d say . . . we can’t say
                                        that definitively. So then it’s a little hard to get enthused, I’d say—isn’t

                                        nylon shoes must be 20 percent of the manufacturing cost of the shoe—unless
                                        there’s a “similar shoe” manufactured by a competitor in the United States. In
                                        which case, the duty must be 20 percent of the competitor’s selling price. So
                                        all our competitors needed to do was make a few shoes in the United States, get
                                        them declared “similar,” then price them sky high—and boom. They could send our
                                        import duties sky high, too. And that’s just what they did. One dirty little
                                        trick, and they’d managed to spike our import duties by 40
                                        percent—­retroactively. Customs was saying we owed them import duties dating
                                        back years, to the tune of $25 million. Dirty trick or not, Strasser told me

                                        Saco, Maine. Later Hayes and Woodell called back and said they’d only been
                                        kidding about buying the factory. “Pulling your chain,” they said. “But you do
                                        need to buy it. You must.” Okay, I said wearily. Okay. Whatever you dummies

                                        company was launching an apparel line, I now started paying closer attention to
                                        what I wore, and what those around me wore. On the second front I was appalled.
                                        Bankers and investors, reps from Nissho, all kinds of people we needed to
                                        impress, were passing through our new halls, and whenever they saw Strasser in
                                        his Hawaiian shirts, or Hayes in his bulldozer-driving outfits, they did
                                        triple-takes. Sometimes our eccentricity was funny. (A top executive at Foot
                                        Locker said, “We think of you guys as gods—until we see your cars.”) But most
                                        times it was embarrassing. And potentially damaging. Thus, around Thanksgiving,

                                        contained his lunch. At first we were in shock. None of us knew what to say.
                                        Finally, someone chuckled. Strasser, probably. Then someone haw-hawed. Woodell,
                                        maybe. Then the dam burst. Everyone was laughing, rocking back and forth,
                                        falling out of their chairs. Nelson saw that he’d goofed, and in a panic he
                                        started stuffing the clothes back into the paper bag, which ripped apart, which
                                        made everyone laugh harder. I was laughing, too, harder than anyone, but at any
                                        moment I felt as if I might start sobbing. Shortly after that day I transferred
                                        Nelson to the newly formed production department, where his considerable
                                        accounting talents helped him do a great job. Then I quietly shifted Woodell to
                                        apparel. He did his typically flawless job, assembling a line that gained
                                        immediate attention and respect in the industry. I asked myself why I didn’t
                                        just let Woodell do everything. Including my job. Maybe he could fly back east
                                        and get the Feds off my back.</em></p>

                                        stunned. I turned to Werschkul, whose face was the color of his pink bow tie.
                                        We’d spent so much time rehearsing this negotiation, preparing to convince
                                        Hatfield of the rightness of our cause, we weren’t ready for the possibility of
                                        . . . success. We leaned into each other. In half whispers we talked about
                                        different ways Hatfield might help. Werschkul thought he should write a letter
                                        to the president of the United States, or maybe the head of customs. I wanted
                                        him to pick up the phone. We couldn’t agree. We started to argue. The air
                                        conditioner seemed to be laughing at us. Finally, I shushed Werschkul, shushed
                                        the air conditioner, turned to Hatfield. “Senator,” I said, “we were not

                                        want. We’ll have to get back to you.” I walked out, not looking back to see if
                                        Werschkul was coming.</em></p>

                                        with a simple logo, and we manufactured it in Saco, at Hayes’s ancient factory.
                                        We priced it low, just above cost. Now customs officials would have to use this
                                        “competitor” shoe as a new reference point in deciding our import duty. That
                                        was the jab. That was just to get their attention. Then we threw the left hook.
                                        We produced a TV commercial telling the story of a little company in Oregon,
                                        fighting the big bad government. It opened on a runner doing his lonely road
                                        work, as a deep voice extolled the ideals of patriotism, liberty, the American
                                        way. And fighting tyranny. It got people pretty fired up. Then we threw the
                                        haymaker. On February 29, 1980, we filed a $25 million antitrust suit in the
                                        U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging that our
                                        competitors, and assorted rubber companies, through underhanded business
                                        practices, had conspired to take us out.</em></p>

                                        said. “What?” “You could issue two classes of stock—class A and class B. The
                                        public would get class Bs, which would carry one vote per share. The founders

                                        which would entitle them to name three-­quarters of the board of directors. In
                                        other words, you raise enormous sums of money, turbocharge your growth, but
                                        ensure that you keep control.” I looked at him, dumbstruck. “Can we really do
                                        that?” “It’s not easy. But the New York Times and the Washington Post and a
                                        couple of others have done it. I think you can do it.” Maybe it wasn’t satori,
                                        or kensho, but it was instant enlightenment. In a flash. The breakthrough I’d

                                        days and sleepless nights, all those magnificent triumphs and desperate
                                        struggles, under that bland, generic banner: business. What we were doing felt
                                        like so much more. Each new day brought fifty new problems, fifty tough
                                        decisions that needed to be made, right now, and we were always acutely aware
                                        that one rash move, one wrong decision could be the end. The margin for error
                                        was forever getting narrower, while the stakes were forever creeping higher—and
                                        none of us wavered in the belief that “stakes” didn’t mean “money.” For some, I
                                        realize, business is the all-out pursuit of profits, period, full stop, but for
                                        us business was no more about making money than being human is about making
                                        blood. Yes, the human body needs blood. It needs to manufacture red and white
                                        cells and platelets and redistribute them evenly, smoothly, to all the right
                                        places, on time, or else. But that day-to-day business of the human body isn’t
                                        our mission as human beings. It’s a basic process that enables our higher aims,
                                        and life always strives to transcend the basic processes of living—and at some
                                        point in the late 1970s, I did, too. I redefined winning, expanded it beyond my
                                        original definition of not losing, of merely staying alive. That was no longer
                                        enough to sustain me, or my company. We wanted, as all great businesses do, to
                                        create, to contribute, and we dared to say so aloud. When you make something,
                                        when you improve something, when you deliver something, when you add some new
                                        thing or service to the lives of strangers, making them happier, or healthier,
                                        or safer, or better, and when you do it all crisply and efficiently, smartly,
                                        the way everything should be done but so seldom is—you’re participating more
                                        fully in the whole grand human drama. More than simply alive, you’re helping
                                        others to live more fully, and if that’s business, all right, call me a
                                        businessman. Maybe it will grow on me.</em></p>

                                <p><em>the process of going public was in full swing. Big choices needed to be made.
                                        Especially: who was going to manage the offering. Public offerings don’t always
                                        succeed. On the contrary, when mismanaged, they turn into train wrecks. So this
                                        was a critical decision right out of the blocks. Chuck, having worked at Kuhn,
                                        Loeb, still had strong relationships with their people, and thought they’d be
                                        best. We interviewed four or five other firms but in the end decided to go with
                                        Chuck’s instincts. He hadn’t steered us wrong yet. Next we had to create a
                                        prospectus. It took fifty drafts, at least, to get it looking and sounding the
                                        way we wanted. Finally, at the tail end of summer, we handed all our paperwork
                                        to the Securities and Exchange Commission, and at the start of September we
                                        released the formal announcement. Nike will be creating 20 million shares of
                                        class A stock and 30 million shares of class B. The price of the stock, we told
                                        the world, would be somewhere between eighteen and twenty-two dollars a share.
                                        TBD. Of 50 million shares, total, almost 30 million would be held in reserve,
                                        and about 2 million class Bs would be sold to the public. Of the roughly 17
                                        million remaining class A shares, the preexisting shareholders, or insiders,
                                        meaning me, Bowerman, the debenture holders, and the Buttfaces, would own 56

                                <p><em>THE NEXT MORNING Hayes and I drove downtown to our law firm. A clerk showed us
                                        into the senior partner’s office. A paralegal dialed Kuhn, Loeb in New York,
                                        then clicked a button on a speaker in the middle of the big walnut desk. Hayes
                                        and I stared at the speaker. Disembodied voices filled the room. One of the
                                        voices grew louder, clearer. “Gentlemen . . . good morning.” “Good morning,” we
                                        said. The loud voice took the lead. It gave a long and careful explanation of
                                        Kuhn, Loeb’s reasoning on the stock price, which was jabberwocky. And so, the
                                        loud voice said, we can’t go any higher than twenty-one dollars. “No,” I said.
                                        “Our number is twenty-two.” We heard the other voices murmuring. They came up
                                        to twenty-­one-fifty. “I’m afraid,” said the loud voice, “that’s our final
                                        offer.” “Gentlemen, twenty-two is our number.” Hayes stared at me. I stared at
                                        the speaker. Cracking silence. We could hear heavy breaths, pops, scrapes.
                                        Papers being shuffled. I closed my eyes and let all that white noise wash over
                                        me. I relived every negotiation in my life to that point. So, Dad, you remember
                                        that Crazy Idea I had at Stanford . . . ? Gentlemen, I represent Blue Ribbon
                                        Sports of Portland, Oregon. You see, Dot, I love Penny. And Penny loves me. And
                                        if things continue in this vein, I see us building a life together. “I’m
                                        sorry,” the loud voice said angrily. “We’ll have to call you back.” Click. We
                                        sat. We said nothing. I took long deep breaths. The clerk’s face slowly melted.
                                        Five minutes passed. Fifteen minutes. Sweat ran down Hayes’s forehead and neck.
                                        The phone rang. The clerk looked at us, to make sure we were ready. We nodded.
                                        He pressed the button on the speaker. “Gentlemen,” the loud voice said. “We
                                        have a deal. We’ll send it out to market this Friday.”</em></p>

                                        Cale—$6.6 million. Woodell, Johnson, Hayes, Strasser—each about $6 million.

                                        Again, I can’t help but think of my trip around the world. The River Jordan.
                                        Mystical Kobe, Japan. That first meeting at Onitsuka, pleading with the
                                        executives for the right to sell Tigers . . . Can this all be a coincidence? I
                                        think of the countless Nike offices around the world. At each one, no matter
                                        the country, the phone number ends in 6453, which spells out Nike on the
                                        keypad. But, by pure chance, from right to left it also spells out Pre’s best
                                        time in the mile, to the tenth of a second: 3:54.6. I say by pure chance, but
                                        is it really? Am I allowed to think that some coincidences are more than
                                        coincidental? Can I be forgiven for thinking, or hoping, that the universe, or
                                        some guiding daemon, has been nudging me, whispering to me? Or else just
                                        playing with me? Can it really be nothing but a fluke of geography that the
                                        oldest shoes ever discovered are a pair of nine-thousand-year-old sandals . . .
                                        salvaged from a cave in Oregon? Is there nothing to the fact that the sandals
                                        were discovered in 1938, the year I was born?</em></p>

                                        tragedy, all the more so because it came after we’d had a falling out. Strasser
                                        had been instrumental in signing Jordan, in building up the Jordan brand and
                                        wrapping it around Rudy’s air soles. Air Jordan changed Nike, took us to the
                                        next level, and the next, but it changed Strasser, too. He felt that he should
                                        no longer be taking orders from anyone, including me. Especially me. We
                                        clashed, too many times, and he quit. It might have been okay if he’d just
                                        quit. But he went to work for Adidas. An intolerable betrayal. I never forgave
                                        him. (Though I did recently—happily, proudly—hire his daughter, Avery.
                                        Twenty-two years old, she works in Special Events, and she’s said to be
                                        thriving. It’s a blessing and a joy to see her name in the company directory.)
                                        I wish Strasser and I had patched things up before he died, but I don’t know
                                        that it was possible. We were both born to compete, and we were both bad at
                                        forgiving. For both of us, betrayal was extra potent kryptonite.</em></p>

                                        nodded. “See those bamboo trees up there?” he asked. “Yes.” “Next year . . .
                                        when you come . . . they will be one foot higher.” I stared. I understood. When
                                        I returned to Oregon I tried hard to cultivate and grow the management team we
                                        had, slowly, with more patience, with an eye toward more training and more
                                        long-term planning. I took the wider, longer view. It worked. The next time I
                                        saw Hayami, I told him. He merely nodded, once, hai, and looked off.</em></p>

                                        also find them far more pessimistic. Occasionally they ask in dismay: “Where is

                                        means, seek it. If you’re following your calling, the fatigue will be easier to
                                        bear, the disappointments will be fuel, the highs will be like nothing you’ve

                                        think. Free enterprise always irritates the kinds of trolls who live to block,
                                        to thwart, to say no, sorry, no. And it’s always been this way. Entrepreneurs
                                        have always been outgunned, outnumbered. They’ve always fought uphill, and the
                                        hill has never been steeper. America is becoming less entrepreneurial, not
                                        more. A Harvard Business School study recently ranked all the countries of the
                                        world in terms of their entrepreneurial spirit. America ranked behind Peru.</em></p>

                                        Athletes get lucky, poets get lucky, businesses get lucky. Hard work is
                                        critical, a good team is essential, brains and determination are invaluable,
                                        but luck may decide the outcome. Some people might not call it luck. They might
                                        call it Tao, or Logos, or Jñāna, or Dharma. Or Spirit. Or God. Put it this way.
                                        The harder you work, the better your Tao. And since no one has ever adequately
                                        defined Tao, I now try to go regularly to mass. I would tell them: Have faith
                                        in yourself, but also have faith in faith. Not faith as others define it. Faith
                                        as you define it. Faith as faith defines itself in your heart. In what format
                                        do I want to say all this? A memoir? No, not a memoir. I can’t imagine how it
