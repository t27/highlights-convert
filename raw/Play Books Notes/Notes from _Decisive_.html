                                        the tendency to define our choices too narrowly, to see them in binary terms.

                                        was difficult because he felt conflicted. The short-term pressures and
                                        political wrangling clouded his mind and obscured the long-term need to exit
                                        the memory business. This brings us to the third villain of decision making:
                                        short-term emotion. When we’ve got a difficult decision to make, our feelings
                                        churn. We replay the same arguments in our head. We agonize about our
                                        circumstances. We change our minds from day to day. If our decision was
                                        represented on a spreadsheet, none of the numbers would be changing—there’s no
                                        new information being added—but it doesn’t feel that way in our heads. We have
                                        kicked up so much dust that we can’t see the way forward. In those moments,
                                        what we need most is perspective.</em></p>

                                        steps: • You encounter a choice. • You analyze your options. • You make a
                                        choice. • Then you live with it. And what we’ve seen is that there is a villain
                                        that afflicts each of these stages: • You encounter a choice. But narrow
                                        framing makes you miss options . • You analyze your options. But the
                                        confirmation bias leads you to gather self-serving information . • You make a
                                        choice. But short-term emotion will often tempt you to make the wrong one . •
                                        Then you live with it. But you’ll often be overconfident about how the future
                                        will unfold . So, at this point, we know what we’re up against. We know the
                                        four top villains of decision making. We also know that the classic
                                        pros-and-cons approach is not well suited to fighting these villains; in fact,
                                        it doesn’t meaningfully counteract any of them. Now we can turn our attention
                                        to a more optimistic question: What’s a process that will help us overcome
                                        these villains and make better choices?</em></p>

                                        better. After the banner-ad study concluded, both sets of designers were
                                        interviewed. Asked to rate the usefulness of the feedback they received during
                                        the design process, over 80% of the simultaneous designers said the feedback
                                        was helpful. Only 35% of the one-at-a-time designers agreed, and in fact, over
                                        half of them believed the feedback they’d received was critical of them. (None
                                        of the simultaneous designers felt criticized.) The simultaneous designers also
                                        reported that, as a result of the experience, they felt more confident in their
                                        design abilities. The one-at-a-time designers didn’t agree. Why was the
                                        experiment so frustrating for the one-at-a-time designers? The study’s authors
                                        speculated that people who work on a single track begin to take their work too
                                        personally, viewing criticism as a “rebuke of their only option.” Or as one of
                                        the authors, Scott Klemmer, said, “If I have only one design, then my ego is
                                        perfectly conflated with my design. But if I have multiple designs, I can
                                        separate the two.” This is a critical point: Multitracking keeps egos in check</em></p>

                                <p><em>So, given the clear benefits of multitracking, what explains the failure of most
                                        organizations to embrace it? Many executives are worried that exploring
                                        multiple options will take too long. It’s a reasonable fear, but the researcher
                                        Kathleen Eisenhardt has found that the opposite is true. In a study of top
                                        leadership teams in Silicon Valley, an environment that tends to place a
                                        premium on speed, she found that executives who weigh more options actually
                                        make faster decisions. It’s a counterintuitive finding, but Eisenhardt offers
                                        three explanations. First, comparing alternatives helps executives to
                                        understand the “landscape”: what’s possible and what’s not, what variables are
                                        involved. That understanding provides the confidence needed to make a quick
                                        decision. Second, considering multiple alternatives seems to undercut politics.
                                        With more options, people get less invested in any one of them, freeing them up
                                        to change positions as they learn. As with the banner-ad study, multitracking
                                        seems to help keep egos under control. Third, when leaders weigh multiple
                                        options, they’ve given themselves a built-in fallback plan. As an example, one
                                        company studied by Eisenhardt was pursuing negotiations with several partners
                                        simultaneously. When the negotiations with the first-choice partner failed, the
                                        president simply cut a deal with the second-choice partner.</em></p>
