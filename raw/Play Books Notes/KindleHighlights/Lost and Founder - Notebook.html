Recruiting for software engineers is best done directly by founders. Find people who look interesting, uncover a connection you have to them in your network, get an intro, meet for coffee, get them excited about your company, and if they’re not interested, ask who they know who might be.

The cheat is to have connections to people—mentors, advisers, friends, family, partners, employees—who’ve been through the problems you’re facing before and can give you a map out of the woods and onto a path that works. You need to be willing to listen. You need a network whose problems and solutions match. But when you can short-circuit the painful quagmire of stumbling through an issue alone, it’s gold.

I still walk to the office from the apartment I share with my wife, Geraldine, run tests that Google wishes I wouldn’t, try to be a force for transparency both internally and externally at Moz, and do my best not to beat myself up for the mistakes of the past. (That last endeavor is the hardest.)

Transparency Is Hard, but It Works
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 329
</div>
<div class="noteText">
Transparency is making the choice to reveal even the most uncomfortable truths with relentless candor. Transparency isn’t the same as honesty. Honesty is saying only things that are true. Many founders and startup teams are honest (in that they don’t directly lie). But transparency requires digging deep to find and expose what others would normally leave unsaid and refusing to take the easy, quiet road. It’s tackling the conversations that make your stomach turn and your voice get caught in your throat. And like nearly everything in the world of startups, swallowing the bitter pill now is vastly superior to letting the disease of opacity fester.

You’d be surprised at how people rise to a challenge once they know that there is a challenge. And don’t kid yourself—you may think you’re keeping them safe by keeping them in the dark, but some distorted version of the truth always leaks. Misinformation stokes fear and resentment in your team. That’s never good for business—or for anyone’s well-being. You need your team’s trust, not just in that one moment when fundraising’s going poorly or growth has stalled, but in the long term. Even after people leave, what they say about you and your trustworthiness will affect basic business functions like recruiting, sales, branding, and bizdev for decades to come.
</div>
<div class="noteHeading">
Highlight (<span class="highlight_yellow">yellow</span>) -  Location 365
</div>
<div class="noteText">
The most meaningful benefit transparency brings might be its forcing function for deliberately ethical, rational behavior. As CEO, I’d often tell my executives and board that every email should be written and every conversation conducted as though it will one day be leaked. We should be proud, not embarrassed, by what and how we communicate, even when the doors are closed. There are good reasons for privacy—to avoid shaming an employee for a mistake or to enable discussion about private, personal, or professional issues (among others). But people change their behavior for the better when they assume their peers, their reports, and their leadership will get to see/hear the full story.

Transparency can’t just be a tactic, though. It has to be a core value that’s consistently followed. If you openly share some things, but hide others, credibility will suffer. Your team will always wonder what you’re not sharing. Your customers, your investors, the press—whomever you interact with—will be trained to mistrust you. A reputation for caginess lasts a long time and follows you across companies and geographies.

When the subscription to our tools opened in February 2007, it didn’t feel like a momentous, overnight transformation. A few new subscribers joined every day, but by and large, business carried on as usual. Our primary focus remained centered on consulting. It was only a few months later, while analyzing our revenue, that we saw the potential of the subscription business. The run rate of our new product was growing like a weed. By the end of that year, we did about $400,000 in SEO consulting revenue (our fourth year in that business), and $450,000 in software revenue (even though we’d only had ten and a half months of it!). It was a wake-up call to the power of having a product that made money while we slept.

There are two traits fundamental to an effective product-focused business. The first is reach (i.e., the ability to influence a large audience). The second is scalability (i.e., an aptitude for growing revenue far more quickly than costs). Traditionally, consulting businesses have little of either.

Financial models that value a company’s revenue care a lot about gross margin (i.e., the percentage of a business’s or product’s income that can be serviced without additional cost). If you build software and provide it to customers, your costs are, basically, maintenance of that software, hosting of the servers, any data you have to buy to keep the software operational, and . . . not a lot else (maybe customer service and support). Conceivably, you could shut down all new development efforts and let go of most of your staff, and the subscription dollars would keep coming in. Hence, gross margins on software product businesses are often higher than 75–80 percent, while the margins on a consultancy are more likely in the 25–40 percent range.

Start with a product that’s informed by your consulting. The services you provide expose you to real-life problems that consumers and organizations face. You have solutions, in the form of applied knowledge, for which people are willing to pay.

Entrepreneurs start out doing what they love. Not because it makes sense, or because it’s a great market, but because they cannot imagine themselves doing (or eating) anything else. On the one hand, that passion and commitment is an asset. It can help early-stage companies push through the ugly barriers that make it so difficult to find a business model. On the other, once there’s a small, working operation that’s found revenue, the leadership needs to refocus on all the tasks a growing organization demands.

I really hope not.” Why? Two reasons. The odds. And the cost.

How VCs Lose, Even When They Win

Venture firms generally get money from four places: large endowments from very wealthy individuals or families; pension funds from big employers; well-endowed university funds; and evil billionaire masterminds. (Technically, the billionaires don’t have to be evil, but then they just fit into the first category.) Together, these sources of capital are called limited partners, or “LPs.” Much as startups raise money from VCs, VCs raise money from LPs. The venture capitalists will try to convince an LP’s investment committee that their approach to startup investment opportunities, their team’s judgment and experience, and their fund’s assistance will produce a winning ROI.

The target is 12 percent annual growth, which, over the life of a ten-year fund, means returning three times the fund size (e.g., $300 million on a $100 million fund). Beating the market is hard. Like, really, really hard. Only about 5 percent of venture investment firms actually succeed at it. A further 10 percent will return two to three times, the next 35 percent will return one to two times, and the bottom 50 percent return less than their initial fund.

The only way the 5 percent of successful VCs make their returns is through enormous outcomes from a tiny number of companies. It’s usually one or two investments out of dozens to hundreds a fund might make that deliver almost all the gains.

From this overly simplified model, anyone considering entry to the world of venture-backed startups should have at least this one crucial takeaway: unless your business is in alignment with the venture model of investing in many failures to find a small handful of absurdly successful mega-winners, this path is not for you. Get comfortable with the odds, or don’t roll the dice. The venture business is about outliers. If you want to raise money, or if you’re joining a startup that’s planning to raise money (or already has), you have to understand these odds and this risk model or you’ll be an unwitting pawn in a game where the deck’s stacked against you. If your startup raises VC, but you’re unwilling to do high-risk things that could kill your business nine out of ten times but might make you a unicorn, you’re not aligned with the venture model. That misalignment can mean losing your job and your company, or getting in a nasty stalemate with your board of directors.

Every VC believed himself or (in, unfortunately, only two cases out of almost fifty) herself to have strong references from their CEOs. I diligently followed up every time, and talked to at least two or three CEOs funded by a dozen or so venture firms. Of those, the majority did have good, though not always glowingly positive, things to say. And even though it was my first time speaking to these CEOs, many were happy to give me an honest and surprisingly cold or even directly negative feedback about their investors. I found this disconnect between the confidence of the partner and the honesty of the founder/CEO valuable and refreshing. If you go down the venture funding path, make sure you do the same. And for those of you who get funded or who already are, please carry on this tradition of putting your fellow entrepreneurs first.

My recollection won’t be perfect, but to the best of my memory, Brad said: I’ve worked with a lot of entrepreneurs over the last fifteen years. Sometimes their first company goes well. Sometimes it doesn’t. But I’m patient. I pick founders because they’re people I want to work with, and I hope I get to work with them again.

If the stories don’t align, you’ll have a strong answer to my third and final suggestion on this topic: don’t sign anything with anyone you don’t trust 100 percent and don’t believe has your best interests (and not just their portfolio’s returns) at heart.

One final, unorthodox tip: if possible, build your expertise before you build your network, and build your network before you build your company. Each one leads elegantly into the next. If you have deep experience and skills in a particular aspect of startup building or technology that makes an hour on the phone with you deeply valuable and valued by entrepreneurs and startup teams, you’ve got a clear, compelling path to build a powerful network. Assist a handful of people and companies with their issues (as a consultant, a member of the team, or simply an outsider who loves to help others) and you’ll have a built-in network to assist in your fundraising process. That network is what takes the fundraising process from near impossibility to potentially achievable.

In essence, founding a startup or being an early employee means taking a risk. You’re sacrificing the certainty of a potentially higher-paying job with greater benefits at a more established company for what is typically a less-than-market-rate salary, bare-bones benefits, and the hope that if things go very well, and your company is one of the few that survive and thrive, your compensation will rise, the benefits will get better, and someday, if you’re extremely lucky, your stock’s value will exceed the delta between what you could have made in another job.

Does this mean you shouldn’t found a startup? Or join an early-stage company? No. But it means you almost certainly shouldn’t do it exclusively for the promise of short-term wealth. The idea that you can compress an entire career into a few years of work and be directly or consistently rewarded with cash for that compression is insanity borne out over and over by the stats. Yes, startups have better odds than the lottery, but they’re dramatically worse than “put it all on red” at the casino.

There are logical, wonderful reasons to start a company or to join a risky, early-stage venture. Chief among these is the freedom early-stage companies provide, especially to founders, to determine what you work on, how to structure that work, who to hire, who to keep on the team, and how every aspect of your organization will operate. Plus, you might have an idea, a product, or a mission that you really want to share with the world. It’s an immense, stressful responsibility, but it’s also intensely rewarding when it works.

One of the great things startups can do is massively accelerate your career path. If you’ve felt trapped in positions that don’t challenge you, or constrain your earnings or influence potential, a few years at a startup, even one that ultimately fails, can dramatically shift that reality. Early-stage companies need people who are self-motivated, mission driven, and can get immense amounts of work done in short periods (by working very hard, by being efficient with their time, or both). Demonstrating that you have strategic vision, the ability to execute, and the qualities needed to recruit, motivate, and lead will make you a rare, desirable commodity in the modern economy. One of the reasons so many early-stage companies sell in small acquisitions (often called “acquihires”) is precisely to get these proven, self-driven, multitalented people on board.

The first is a shared commitment among the team. In a company with hundreds of people, there will naturally be tension, disagreement, and occasional discord.

Let me make a few points about identifying core values, for without this stake firmly in the ground, there can be no effective alignment. First, you cannot “set” organizational values, you can only discover them. Nor can you “install” new core values into people. Core values are not something people “buy in” to. People must be predisposed to holding them. Executives often ask me, “How do we get people to share our core values?” You don’t. Instead, the task is to find people who are already predisposed to sharing your core values. You must attract and then retain these people and let those who aren’t predisposed to sharing your core values go elsewhere.—Jim Collins, “Aligning Action and Values”

There are three common ways values fail at organizations: First is when they’re viewed by the team as merely paper platitudes, hung on a plaque on the wall but not consistently enforced.

Real values have costs. They’re difficult to embody. A lot of people (but hopefully not the ones you recruit) will disagree with them. People internally and externally should, at least some of the time, view them as a barrier to making a financially beneficial decision. Real values are truths you hold to be more important than making money. They will come into conflict, and you’ll have to make that hard decision and show everyone on your team why you’re choosing that path, not just once, but over and over in order to instill the idea that values mean something at your organization.

Every company has unspoken rules and idiosyncrasies that take time to learn.

if you already have a big following with high expectations, publicly launching a traditional MVP (one that leans more to the “minimum” side of the acronym than the “viable” side) can be disastrous.

It is absolutely the right move to first build an MVP. Developing every feature to perfection before you have anything people can test in the real world can be devastating. But as we saw in chapter 11, depending on your brand’s size and reach, and on the customers and potential customers you’ll influence with a launch, I’d urge you to consider whether a private launch of that MVP, with lots of testing, learning, and iteration to a smaller audience that knows they’re beta testing, could be the best path.

For me, the lesson about MVPs versus EVPs was a powerful one. In the future, I don’t think I’d ever willingly publicly release a product that leans minimum rather than exceptional (at least, not with a brand that has any substantial reach).

I’ve talked to dozens if not hundreds of founders about this exact phenomenon. Everyone who’s had an exit agrees that it brings with it an almost mystical sense of closure and accomplishment. And everyone who hasn’t yet confirms that same sense of striving and hopefulness and desperate desire to cross that mentally dominating finish line.

the line between being great at the work yourself and being a great manager of the people doing that work is largely disconnected. I will absolutely concede that much of the time, great people managers were good at, or at least performed, the jobs of their reports at one time or another. But that, my friends, is correlation, not causation. Just because most managers apply for and are promoted into their role by virtue of their IC work in that same arena does not mean that IC work is necessarily connected to effective management.

On the great teams I’ve observed in which the manager did not possess technical skills, there was often a surprising benefit: the team members themselves upgraded one another’s skills, mentored one another, and more often, took greater responsibility for the output of the work. I suspect that’s because in teams with managers who possess their own strong technical skills, the work gets done their way, and the improvement in skills tends to be clustered around the managers’ specific strengths. It also strikes me that because of the reliance on these highly skilled managers, there’s less individual effort given by the team’s members to explore and expand on their own.

When teams felt safe expressing personal issues, sharing mistakes, and speaking up without the risk of harsh criticism or judgment, they dramatically outperformed their peers. This, above all other attributes researchers have been able to identify or measure, correlates with strong team output and work quality. Emotional comfort with one’s colleagues was a better predictor than IQ, than years of experience, than the strength of previous work, than literally any and everything else researchers had hypothesized about.

Pro Tip: Digging into this skepticism in group settings can be hard and uncomfortable, particularly for more introverted folks or those who don’t have experience working with a team. I’ve had far better luck taking the time to get folks in a room one-on-one, walking through the plans, and asking for their feedback, their questions, and their concerns. Yes, it’s much more time-consuming, but it also means that when you get into a room all together or buckle down to do the work, the big conflicts have already been thought through and worked through. This isn’t just for the sake of project contributors; it’s for leaders and managers, too.

Near the start of the session, Brad asked all the CEOs in the room to raise their hand if they had experienced severe anxiety, depression, or other emotional or mental disorders during their tenure as CEO. Every hand in the room went up, save two. At that moment, a sense of relief washed over me, so powerful I almost cried in my chair. I thought I was alone, a frail, former CEO who’d lost his job because he couldn’t handle the stress and pressure and caved in to depression. But those hands in the air made me realize I was far from alone—I was, in fact, part of an overwhelming majority, at least among this group. That mental transition from loneliness and shame to a peer among equals forever changed the way I thought about depression and the stigma around mental disorders. I am not alone. Neither are you.

To make progress on this spectrum, we have to be willing to accept that what we believe we know about ourselves may not be true, have the courage to question our beliefs, and start from a place without preexisting assumptions. I like how Dr. Jonathan Koomey phrases it in his blog post on intellectual honesty: Someone who is intellectually honest follows the facts where ever they may lead, and does so in spite of discomfort, inconvenience, or self-interest.

Pro Tip: When you invest in behaviors based on your newfound knowledge, don’t try to control the outcome, just the behavior. This holds equally true for your startup as for your emotional health. Because, as much as we wish we could, we never have full control over outcomes. We own our behavior, and some of the time (hopefully often), the right behaviors lead to the outcomes we want. Recognizing this is crucial, because many people and organizations reward outcomes rather than behavior. That can lead to punishing good behaviors if the outcome isn’t the desired one, even if the forces were outside our control. And it can lead to reinforcing bad behaviors simply because they led to a good outcome

Remember how “growth hacks” are almost always inferior to consistent investments in the right marketing channels and tactics for your strengths and your audience? The same principle applies to your life. It’s almost never the case that you’ll transform your personal psychology and manage your emotional and mental health long term with a single or even a handful of hacks. The “I was depressed but then I installed this great mindfulness app and now I’m teaching my therapist how to live a happy life” story goes right up there with “I was hooked on In-N-Out burgers and Pixy Stix; couldn’t program my way out of a Raspberry Pi. But I switched all my meals to Soylent and now I’m a lean, mean, code-crushin’ machine.” When you invest in a behavior, invest in *just* the behavior. Assess it based on its strengths and weaknesses, its costs and returns. Anti-work night didn’t solve my depression, so I stopped doing it for more than six months. But when I had the revelation that behaviors trump outcomes, I brought it back. I did the same with physical therapy and exercise. I skipped the mindfulness app, the meditation, the acupuncture, and the herbal medicines.

at Moz, we’ve invested in behaviors we believe are healthy, even when they don’t have consistently positive outcomes. Our approach to launching internal MVPs and iterating until they’re earning praise and accolades from industry influencers has had great results for some projects, and mediocre results for others, but we’re investing in the behavior. Conversely, we found performance reviews to be a behavior that wasn’t working for us, even though they could sometimes be connected to positive outcomes.

Negative experiences with brands tend to overwhelm every other data point (no one thinks “the team making the lawn mowers probably isn’t the same one that makes the cars; maybe I should give them a chance”). But positive experiences don’t have nearly the same strength of association. Human beings are wired to remember and internalize negative experiences with vastly greater force than positive ones, hence the much greater likelihood that you’ll leave a bad review than a good one. It’s not just the potential for negative experiences that carry over from product to product, though. The mere existence of multiple products from a brand causes cognitive strain and a weakening of memory and relevant associations. A company that makes only a single product is vastly easier to recall, amplify, and evaluate.

When you’re building a company from the ground up, for the first time, in a new field, with a new team, you need all the simplicity you can get. Everything is going to be uniquely challenging because you and your team haven’t seen it or done it before, and because market forces are inherently structured to benefit incumbents. The great strength startups usually have is that they can uniquely focus all their energy on just one thing, whereas their incumbent competitors have diverse efforts and responsibilities that impede progress. Losing focus and asking your small team(s) to take on more tasks rather than do one thing better costs you this critical advantage.

Switching costs in software is usually a big challenge for startups versus incumbents. If you become the default tool in a field or for a particular type of user, you can often maintain market leadership even if your competition produces a technically superior product. It’s why in order to compete, startups often need to be a vastly better choice along multiple dimensions (ease of use, features, data quality, price, etc.) than their entrenched competitors.

When you’re an early-stage startup founder, your job is clear—find “product:market fit” (Silicon Valley–speak for “a product that a significant portion of customers in your market love, use, and will pay for”), then scale. Beyond that, things get murkier. Once you have “fit” and are scaling, your job is to find growth through any means possible. Greater growth means higher valuations, the ability to attract better talent, the envy of your peers, the coveted press and prestige, the possibility to sell your company or your stock and become wealthy; all of it is dependent on growth as measured by the percentage of year-over-year revenue addition (at least, in the case of companies with revenue). That bias rapidly leads to thinking along lines like “Our core product is growing, but I bet we could grow even faster if we . . .” Filling in that blank is dangerous, because it’s almost always occupied by something that adds complexity and removes focus. Maybe it’s new features you believe could get you more growth, or a whole new product line, or the acquisition of another company, or a few R&D projects that could yield the next big thing. Silicon Valley startup culture embeds founders with the false belief that because growth is what matters most, we should pursue any and all strategies that could lead us there.

Doing the work that I’ve just described can seem like it’s putting the cart before the horse. But I’d counter that asking these questions is a forcing function for greater thoughtfulness about your business as a whole and boosts the odds of surviving those early, perilous years. No matter what stage of life your organization is in today, my advice is to have a written, transparent road map. Plans change. The value of a team with a shared plan doesn’t.
