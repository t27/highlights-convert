            That evolution should select for larger brains may seem to us like, well, a no- brainer. We are so enamoured

            The fact is that a jumbo brain is a jumbo drain on the body. It’s not easy to carry around, especially when
            encased inside a massive skull. It’s even harder to fuel. In Homo sapiens, the brain accounts for about 2– 3
            per cent of total body weight, but it consumes 25 per cent of the body’s energy when the body is at rest. By
            comparison, the brains of other apes require only 8 per cent of rest- time energy.

            Women who gave birth earlier, when the infant’s brain and head were still relatively small and supple, fared
            better and lived to have more children. Natural selection consequently favoured earlier births. And, indeed,
            compared to other animals, humans are born prematurely, when many of their vital systems are still
            underdeveloped. A colt can trot shortly after birth; a kitten leaves its mother to forage on its own when it
            is just a few weeks old. Human babies are helpless, dependent for many years on their elders for sustenance,
            protection and education.

            neighbours. It takes a tribe to raise a human. Evolution thus favoured those capable of forming strong
            social ties. In addition, since humans are born underdeveloped, they can be educated and socialised to a far
            greater extent than any other animal. Most mammals emerge from the womb like glazed earthenware emerging
            from a kiln– any attempt at remoulding will only scratch or break them. Humans emerge from the womb like
            molten glass from a furnace. They can be spun, stretched and shaped with a surprising degree of freedom.
            This is why today we can educate our children to become Christian or Buddhist, capitalist or socialist,
            warlike or peace- loving.

            Genus Homo’s position in the food chain was, until quite recently, solidly in the middle. For millions of
            years, humans hunted smaller creatures and gathered what they could, all the while being hunted by larger
            predators. It was only 400,000 years ago that several species of man began to hunt large game on a regular
            basis, and only in the last 100,000 years– with the rise of Homo sapiens– that man jumped to the top of the
            food chain.

            Other animals at the top of the pyramid, such as lions and sharks, evolved into that position very
            gradually, over millions of years. This enabled the ecosystem to develop checks and balances that prevent

            In contrast, humankind ascended to the top so quickly that the ecosystem was not given time to adjust.
            Moreover, humans themselves failed to adjust. Most top predators of the planet are majestic creatures.
            Millions of years of dominion have filled them with self- confidence. Sapiens by contrast is more like a

            fears and anxieties over our position, which makes us doubly cruel and dangerous. Many historical

            the best thing fire did was cook. Foods that humans cannot digest in their natural forms– such as wheat,
            rice and potatoes– became staples of our diet thanks to cooking. Fire not only changed food’s chemistry, it
            changed its biology as well. Cooking killed germs and parasites that infested food. Humans also had a far
            easier time chewing and digesting old favourites such as fruits, nuts, insects and carrion if they were
            cooked. Whereas chimpanzees spend five hours a day chewing raw food, a single hour suffices for people
            eating cooked food.

            Most importantly, the power of fire was not limited by the form, structure or strength of the human body. A
            single woman with a flint or fire stick could burn down an entire forest in a matter of hours. The
            domestication of fire was a sign of things to come.

            We don’t know exactly where and when animals that can be classified as Homo sapiens first evolved from some

            Scientists also agree that about 70,000 years ago, Sapiens from East Africa spread into the Arabian
            peninsula, and from there they quickly overran the entire Eurasian landmass. When Homo sapiens landed in
            Arabia, most of Eurasia was already settled by other humans. What happened to them? There are two
            conflicting theories.

            According to the Interbreeding Theory, when Sapiens spread into Neanderthal lands, Sapiens bred with
            Neanderthals until the two populations merged. If this is the case, then today’s Eurasians are not pure
            Sapiens. They are a mixture of Sapiens and Neanderthals. Similarly, when Sapiens reached East Asia, they
            interbred with the local Erectus, so the Chinese and Koreans are a mixture of Sapiens and Erectus.

            The opposing view, called the ‘Replacement Theory’ tells a very different story– one of incompatibility,
            revulsion, and perhaps even genocide. According to this theory, Sapiens and other humans had different
            anatomies, and most likely different mating habits and even body odours. They would have had little sexual
            interest in one another. And even if a Neanderthal Romeo and a Sapiens Juliet fell in love, they could not
            produce fertile children, because the genetic gulf separating the two populations was already unbridgeable.
            The two populations remained completely distinct, and when the Neanderthals died out, or were killed off,
            their genes died with them. According to this view, Sapiens replaced all the previous human populations
            without merging with them. If that is the case, the lineages of all contemporary humans can be traced back,
            exclusively, to East Africa, 70,000 years ago. We are all ‘pure Sapiens’.

            A lot hinges on this debate. From an evolutionary perspective, 70,000 years is a relatively short interval.
            If the Replacement Theory is correct, all living humans have roughly the same genetic baggage, and racial
            distinctions among them are negligible. But if the Interbreeding Theory is right, there might well be
            genetic differences between Africans, Europeans and Asians that go back hundreds of thousands of years. This
            is political dynamite, which could provide material for explosive racial theories.

            It turned out that 1– 4 per cent of the unique human DNA of modern populations in the Middle East and Europe

            why did they vanish? One possibility is that Homo sapiens drove them to extinction. Imagine a Sapiens band
            reaching a Balkan valley where Neanderthals had lived for hundreds of thousands of years. The newcomers
            began to hunt the deer and gather the nuts and berries that were the Neanderthals’ traditional staples.
            Sapiens were more proficient hunters and gatherers– thanks to better technology and superior social skills–
            so they multiplied and spread. The less resourceful Neanderthals found it increasingly difficult to feed
            themselves. Their population dwindled and they slowly died out, except perhaps for one or two members who
            joined their Sapiens neighbours.

            Another possibility is that competition for resources flared up into violence and genocide. Tolerance is not
            a Sapiens trademark. In modern times, a small difference in skin colour, dialect or religion has been enough
            to prompt one group of Sapiens to set about exterminating another group. Would ancient Sapiens have been
            more tolerant towards an entirely different human species? It may well be that when Sapiens encountered
            Neanderthals, the result was the first and most significant ethnic- cleansing campaign in history.

            During most of recorded history property could be owned only by flesh- and- blood humans, the kind that
            stood on two legs and had big brains. If in thirteenth- century France Jean set up a wagon- manufacturing
            workshop, he himself was the business. If a wagon he’d made broke down a week after purchase, the
            disgruntled buyer would have sued Jean personally. If Jean had borrowed 1,000 gold coins to set up his
            workshop and the business failed, he would have had to repay the loan by selling his private property– his
            house, his cow, his land. He might even have had to sell his children into servitude. If he couldn’t cover
            the debt, he could be thrown in prison by the state or enslaved by his creditors. He was fully liable,
            without limit, for all obligations incurred by his workshop. If you had lived back then, you would probably
            have thought twice before you opened an enterprise of your own. And indeed this legal situation discouraged

            This is why people began collectively to imagine the existence of limited liability companies. Such
            companies were legally independent of the people who set them up, or invested money in them, or managed
            them. Over the last few centuries such companies have become the main players in the economic arena, and we
            have grown so used to them that we forget they exist only in our imagination. In the US, the technical term
            for a limited liability company is a ‘corporation’, which is ironic, because the term derives from ‘corpus’
            (‘ body’ in Latin)– the one thing these corporations lack. Despite their having no real bodies, the American

            In the case of Peugeot SA the crucial story was the French legal code, as written by the French parliament.
            According to the French legislators, if a certified lawyer followed all the proper liturgy and rituals,
            wrote all the required spells and oaths on a wonderfully decorated piece of paper, and affixed his ornate
            signature to the bottom of the document, then hocus pocus– a new company was incorporated. When in 1896
            Armand Peugeot wanted to create his company, he paid a lawyer to go through all these sacred procedures.
            Once the lawyer had performed all the right rituals and pronounced all the necessary spells and oaths,
            millions of upright French citizens behaved as if the Peugeot company really existed. Telling effective
            stories is not easy. The difficulty lies not in telling the story, but in convincing everyone else to
            believe it. Much of history revolves around this question: how does one convince millions of people to
            believe particular stories about gods, or nations, or limited liability companies? Yet when it succeeds, it
            gives Sapiens immense power, because it enables millions of strangers to cooperate and work towards common

            change and develop, and these unstoppable alterations are what we call ‘history’.

            sowed seeds, watered plants, plucked weeds from the ground and led sheep to prime pastures. This work, they

            What potential did Europe develop in the early modern period that enabled it to dominate the late modern
            world? There are two complementary answers to this question: modern science and capitalism. Europeans were
            used to thinking and behaving in a scientific and capitalist way even before they enjoyed any significant
            technological advantages.

            The discovery of America was the foundational event of the Scientific Revolution. It not only taught
            Europeans to favour present observations over past traditions, but the desire to conquer America also
            obliged Europeans to search for new knowledge at breakneck speed. If they really wanted to control the vast
            new territories, they had to gather enormous amounts of new data about the geography, climate, flora, fauna,

            These European explore- and- conquer expeditions are so familiar to us that we tend to overlook just how
            extraordinary they were. Nothing like them had ever happened before. Long- distance campaigns of conquest
            are not a natural undertaking. Throughout history most human societies were so busy with local conflicts and
            neighbourhood quarrels that they never considered exploring and conquering distant lands. Most great empires
            extended their control only over their immediate neighbourhood– they reached far- flung lands simply because
            their neighbourhood kept expanding.

            Modern science and modern empires were motivated by the restless feeling that perhaps something important

            For modern Europeans, building an empire was a scientific project, while setting up a scientific discipline
            was an imperial project. When the Muslims conquered India, they did not bring along archaeologists to
            systematically study Indian history, anthropologists to study Indian cultures, geologists to study Indian
            soils, or zoologists to study Indian fauna. When the British conquered India, they did all of these things.
            On 10 April 1802 the Great Survey of India was launched. It lasted sixty years. With the help of tens of
            thousands of native labourers, scholars and guides, the British carefully mapped the whole of India, marking
            borders, measuring distances, and even calculating for the first time the exact height of Mount Everest and
            the other Himalayan peaks. The British explored the military resources of Indian provinces and the location
            of their gold mines, but they also took the trouble to collect information about rare Indian spiders, to
            catalogue colourful butterflies, to trace the ancient origins of extinct Indian languages, and to dig up
            forgotten ruins.

            Thanks to the work of people like William Jones and Henry Rawlinson, the European conquerors knew their
            empires very well. Far better, indeed, than any previous conquerors, or even than the native population
            itself. Their superior knowledge had obvious practical advantages. Without such knowledge, it is unlikely
            that a ridiculously small number of Britons could have succeeded in governing, oppressing and exploiting so
            many hundreds of millions of Indians for two centuries. Throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth
            centuries, fewer than 5,000 British officials, about 40,000– 70,000 British soldiers, and perhaps another
            100,000 British business people, hangers- on, wives and children were sufficient to conquer and rule up to
            300 million Indians.

            No less important was the fact that science gave the empires ideological justification. Modern Europeans

            In truth, neither the narrative of oppression and exploitation nor that of ‘the White Man’s burden’
            completely matches the facts. The European empires did so many different things on such a large scale, that
            you can find plenty of examples to support whatever you want to say about them. You think that these empires
            were evil monstrosities that spread death, oppression and injustice around the world? You could easily fill
            an encyclopedia with their crimes. You want to argue that they in fact improved the conditions of their
            subjects with new medicines, better economic conditions and greater security? You could fill another

            much power and changed the world to such an extent that perhaps they cannot be simply labelled as good or

            For most of history the economy stayed much the same size. Yes, global production increased, but this was
            due mostly to demographic expansion and the settlement of new lands. Per capita production remained static.
            But all that changed in the modern age. In 1500, global production of goods and services was equal to about
            $ 250 billion; today it hovers around $ 60 trillion. More importantly, in 1500, annual per capita production

            Humankind was trapped in this predicament for thousands of years. As a result, economies remained frozen.

            trust in the future. In it, people agreed to represent imaginary goods– goods that do not exist in the

            Credit arrangements of one kind or another have existed in all known human cultures, going back at least to
            ancient Sumer. The problem in previous eras was not that no one had the idea or knew how to use it. It was
            that people seldom wanted to extend much credit because they didn’t trust that the future would be better
            than the present. They generally believed that times past had been better than their own times and that the
            future would be worse, or at best much the same. To put that in economic terms, they believed that the total
            amount of wealth was limited, if not dwindling. People therefore considered it a bad bet to assume that they
            personally, or their kingdom, or the entire world, would be producing more wealth ten years down the line.
            Business looked like a zero- sum game. Of course, the profits of one particular bakery might rise, but only
            at the expense of the bakery next door. Venice might flourish, but only by impoverishing Genoa. The king of
            England might enrich himself, but only by robbing the king of France. You could cut the pie in many

            If the global pie stayed the same size, there was no margin for credit. Credit is the difference between
            today’s pie and tomorrow’s pie. If the pie stays the same, why extend credit? It would be an unacceptable
            risk unless you believed that the baker or king asking for your money might be able to steal a slice from a
            competitor. So it was hard to get a loan in the premodern world, and when you got one it was usually small,
            short- term, and subject to high interest rates. Upstart entrepreneurs thus found it difficult to open new
            bakeries and great kings who wanted to build palaces or wage wars had no choice but to raise the necessary
            funds through high taxes and tariffs. That was fine for kings (as long as their subjects remained docile),
            but a scullery maid who had a great idea for a bakery and wanted to move up in the world generally could
            only dream of wealth while scrubbing down the royal kitchen’s floors.

            and opened the way for even more credit. It didn’t happen overnight– the economy behaved more like a roller

            In 1776 the Scottish economist Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations, probably the most important
            economics manifesto of all time. In the eighth chapter of its first volume, Smith made the following novel
            argument: when a landlord, a weaver or a shoemaker has greater profits than he needs to maintain his own
            family, he uses the surplus to employ more assistants, in order to further increase his profits. The more
            profits he has, the more assistants he can employ. It follows that an increase in the profits of private
            entrepreneurs is the basis for the increase in collective wealth and prosperity. This may not strike you as
            very original, because we all live in a capitalist world that takes Smith’s argument for granted. We hear
            variations on this theme every day in the news. Yet Smith’s claim that the selfish human urge to increase
            private profits is the basis for collective wealth is one of the most revolutionary ideas in human history–
            revolutionary not just from an economic perspective, but even more so from a moral and political
            perspective. What Smith says is, in fact, that greed is good, and that by becoming richer I benefit
            everybody, not just myself. Egoism is altruism.

            In Smith’s story, people become rich not by despoiling their neighbours, but by increasing the overall size
            of the pie. And when the pie grows, everyone benefits. The rich are accordingly the most useful and
            benevolent people in society, because they turn the wheels of growth for everyone’s advantage.

            All this depends, however, on the rich using their profits to open new factories and hire new employees,
            rather than wasting them on non- productive activities. Smith therefore repeated like a mantra the maxim
            that ‘When profits increase, the landlord or weaver will employ more assistants’ and not ‘When profits
            increase, Scrooge will hoard his money in a chest and take it out only to count his coins.’ A crucial part
            of the modern capitalist economy was the emergence of a new ethic, according to which profits ought to be
            reinvested in production. This brings about more profits, which are again reinvested in production, which
            brings more profits, et cetera ad infinitum. Investments can be made in many ways: enlarging the factory,
            conducting scientific research, developing new products. Yet all these investments must somehow increase
            production and translate into larger profits. In the new capitalist creed, the first and most sacred
            commandment is: ‘The profits of production must be reinvested in increasing production.’

            That’s why capitalism is called ‘capitalism’. Capitalism distinguishes ‘capital’ from mere ‘wealth’. Capital
            consists of money, goods and resources that are invested in production. Wealth, on the other hand, is buried
            in the ground or wasted on unproductive activities. A pharaoh who pours resources into a non- productive
            pyramid is not a capitalist. A pirate who loots a Spanish treasure fleet and buries a chest full of
            glittering coins on the beach of some Caribbean island is not a capitalist. But a hard- working factory hand
            who reinvests part of his income in the stock market is. The idea that ‘The profits of production must be

            companies that entitled their holders to receive a portion of the company’s profits. Cautious investors who
            would never have given their money to the king of Spain, and who would have thought twice before extending
            credit to the Dutch government, happily invested fortunes in the Dutch joint- stock companies that were the
            mainstay of the new empire. If you thought a company was going to make a big profit but it had already sold
            all its shares, you could buy some from people who owned them, probably for a higher price than they
            originally paid. If you bought shares and later discovered that the company was in dire straits, you could
            try to unload your stock for a lower price. The resulting trade in company shares led to the establishment
            in most major European cities of stock exchanges, places where the shares of companies were traded.

            Adam Smith taught that the shoemaker would use his surplus to employ more assistants. This implies that

            employees. Yet what happens if the greedy shoemaker increases his profits by paying employees less and

            work for his competitors. The tyrant shoemaker would find himself left with the worst labourers, or with no

            This is the fly in the ointment of free- market capitalism. It cannot ensure that profits are gained in a

            After 1908, and especially after 1945, capitalist greed was somewhat reined in, not least due to the fear of
            Communism. Yet inequities are still rampant. The economic pie of 2014 is far larger than the pie of 1500,
            but it is distributed so unevenly that many African peasants and Indonesian labourers return home after a
            hard day’s work with less food than did their ancestors 500 years ago. Much like the Agricultural
            Revolution, so too the growth of the modern economy might turn out to be a colossal fraud. The human species
            and the global economy may well keep growing, but many more individuals may live in hunger and want.
            Capitalism has two answers to this criticism. First, capitalism has created a world that nobody but a
            capitalist is capable of running. The only serious attempt to manage the world differently– Communism– was
            so much worse in almost every conceivable way that nobody has the stomach to try again. In 8500 BC one could
            cry bitter tears over the Agricultural Revolution, but it was too late to give up agriculture. Similarly, we
            may not like capitalism, but we cannot live without it. The second answer is that we just need more
            patience– paradise, the capitalists promise, is right around the corner. True, mistakes have been made, such
            as the Atlantic slave trade and the exploitation of the European working class. But we have learned our
            lesson, and if we just wait a little longer and allow the pie to grow a little bigger, everybody will
            receive a fatter slice. The division of spoils will never be equitable, but there will be enough to satisfy
            every man, woman and child– even in the Congo.

            significantly higher than it was in 1914, despite the exponential growth in the number of humans. Yet can
            the economic pie grow indefinitely? Every pie requires raw materials and energy. Prophets of doom warn that

            organisms are doing quite well. Rats and cockroaches, for example, are in their heyday. These tenacious
            creatures would probably creep out from beneath the smoking rubble of a nuclear Armageddon, ready and able
            to spread their DNA. Perhaps 65 million years from now, intelligent rats will look back gratefully on the
            decimation wrought by humankind, just as we today can thank that dinosaur- busting asteroid.

            Still, the rumours of our own extinction are premature. Since the Industrial Revolution, the world’s human
            population has burgeoned as never before. In 1700 the world was home to some 700 million humans. In 1800
            there were 950 million of us. By 1900 we almost doubled our numbers to 1.6 billion. And by 2000 that
            quadrupled to 6 billion. Today there are just shy of 7 billion Sapiens.

            The Industrial Revolution brought about dozens of major upheavals in human society. Adapting to industrial
            time is just one of them. Other notable examples include urbanisation, the disappearance of the peasantry,
            the rise of the industrial proletariat, the empowerment of the common person, democratisation, youth culture

            First and foremost, the price of war has gone up dramatically. The Nobel Peace Prize to end all peace prizes
            should have been given to Robert Oppenheimer and his fellow architects of the atomic bomb. Nuclear weapons
            have turned war between superpowers into collective suicide, and made it impossible to seek world domination

            Secondly, while the price of war soared, its profits declined. For most of history, polities could enrich
            themselves by looting or annexing enemy territories. Most wealth consisted of material things like fields,
            cattle, slaves and gold, so it was easy to loot it or occupy it. Today, wealth consists mainly of human
            capital and organisational know- how. Consequently it is difficult to carry it off or conquer it by military

            THE LAST 500 years have witnessed a breathtaking series of revolutions. The earth has been united into a
            single ecological and historical sphere. The economy has grown exponentially, and humankind today enjoys the
            kind of wealth that used to be the stuff of fairy tales. Science and the Industrial Revolution have given
            humankind superhuman powers and practically limitless energy. The social order has been completely

            Most current ideologies and political programmes are based on rather flimsy ideas concerning the real source
            of human happiness. Nationalists believe that political self- determination is essential for our happiness.
            Communists postulate that everyone would be blissful under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Capitalists
            maintain that only the free market can ensure the greatest happiness of the greatest number, by creating
            economic growth and material abundance and by teaching people to be self- reliant and enterprising.

            The first step is to define what is to be measured. The generally accepted definition of happiness is
            ‘subjective well- being’. Happiness, according to this view, is something I feel inside myself, a sense of
            either immediate pleasure or long- term contentment with the way my life is going. If it’s something felt
            inside, how can it be measured from outside? Presumably, we can do so by asking people to tell us how they
            feel. So psychologists or biologists who want to assess how happy people feel give them questionnaires to
            fill out and tally the results.

            One interesting conclusion is that money does indeed bring happiness. But only up to a point, and beyond
            that point it has little significance. For people stuck at the bottom of the economic ladder, more money
            means greater happiness.

        <div class="noteText">
            Another interesting finding is that illness decreases happiness in the short term, but is a source of long-
            term distress only if a person’s condition is constantly deteriorating or if the disease involves ongoing
            and debilitating pain. People who are diagnosed with chronic illness such as diabetes are usually depressed
            for a while, but if the illness does not get worse they adjust to their new condition and rate their
            happiness as highly as healthy people do.

            Family and community seem to have more impact on our happiness than money and health. People with strong
            families who live in tight- knit and supportive communities are significantly happier than people whose
            families are dysfunctional and who have never found (or never sought) a community to be part of. Marriage is
            particularly important. Repeated studies have found that there is a very close correlation between good
            marriages and high subjective well- being, and between bad marriages and misery. This holds true
            irrespective of economic or even physical conditions. An impecunious invalid surrounded by a loving spouse,
            a devoted family and a warm community may well feel better than an alienated billionaire, provided that the
            invalid’s poverty is not too severe and that his illness is not degenerative or painful.

        <div class="noteText">
            But the most important finding of all is that happiness does not really depend on objective conditions of
            either wealth, health or even community. Rather, it depends on the correlation between objective conditions
            and subjective expectations. If you want a bullock- cart and get a bullock- cart, you are content. If you
            want a brand- new Ferrari and get only a second- hand Fiat you feel deprived. This is why winning the
            lottery has, over time, the same impact on people’s happiness as a debilitating car accident. When things
            improve, expectations balloon, and consequently even dramatic improvements in objective conditions can leave
            us dissatisfied.

            If happiness depended only on objective conditions such as wealth, health and social relations, it would
            have been relatively easy to investigate its history. The finding that it depends on subjective expectations
            makes the task of historians far harder.

            Like all other mental states, our subjective well- being is not determined by external parameters such as
            salary, social relations or political rights. Rather, it is determined by a complex system of nerves,
            neurons, synapses and various biochemical substances such as serotonin, dopamine and oxytocin.

            People are made happy by one thing and one thing only– pleasant sensations in their bodies. A person who

            She is reacting to various hormones coursing through her bloodstream, and to the storm of electric signals
            flashing between different parts of her brain.

            Some scholars compare human biochemistry to an air- conditioning system that keeps the temperature constant,

            Human happiness conditioning systems also differ from person to person. On a scale from one to ten, some
            people are born with a cheerful biochemical system that allows their mood to swing between levels six and
            ten, stabilising with time at eight.

            It could be that happiness causes marriage. Or more correctly, that serotonin, dopamine and oxytocin bring
            about and maintain a marriage. People who are born with a cheerful biochemistry are generally happy and
            content. Such people are more attractive spouses, and consequently they have a greater chance of getting
            married. They are also less likely to divorce, because it is far easier to live with a happy and content
            spouse than with a depressed and dissatisfied one.

            the findings demonstrate that happiness is not the surplus of pleasant over unpleasant moments. Rather,
            happiness consists in seeing one’s life in its entirety as meaningful and worthwhile. There is an important
            cognitive and ethical component to happiness. Our values make all the difference to whether we see ourselves

            However, if they believed the promise of everlasting bliss in the afterlife, they may well have viewed their
