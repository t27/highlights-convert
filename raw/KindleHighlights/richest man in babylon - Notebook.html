"Preceding accomplishment must be desire. Thy desires must be strong and definite. Generaldesires are but weak longings. For a man to wish to be rich is of little purpose. For a man to desire fivepieces of gold is a tangible desire which he can press to fulfillment. After he has backed his desire forfive pieces of gold with strength of purpose to secure it, next he can find similar ways to obtain tenpieces and then twenty pieces and later a thousand pieces and, behold, he has become wealthy. Inlearning to secure his one definite small desire, he hath trained himself to secure a larger one.

THE FIVE LAWS OF GOLD I. Gold cometh gladly and in increasing quantity to any man who will put by not less thanone-tenth of his earngs to create an estate for his future and that of his family. II. Gold laboreth diligently and contentedly for the wise owner who finds for it profitableemployment, multiplying even as the flocks of the field. III. Gold clingeth to the protection of the cautious owner who invests it under the advice ofmen wise in its handling. IV. Gold slippeth away from the man who invests it in businesses or purposes with whichhe is not familiar or which are not approved by those skilled in its keep. V. Gold flees the man who would force it to impossible earnings or who followeth thealluring advice of tricksters and schemers or who trusts it to his own inexperience and romanticdesires in investment.

"From each person to whom I lend, I do exact a token for my token chest, to remain there untilthe loan is repaid. When they repay I give back, but if they never repay it will always remind me of onewho was not faithful to my confidence. "The safest loans, my token box tells me, are to those whose possessions are of more value thanthe one they desire. They own lands, or jewels, or camels, or other things which could be sold to repaythe loan. Some of the tokens given to me are jewels of more value than the loan. Others are promisesthat if the loan be not repaid as agreed they will deliver to me certain property settlement. On loans likethose I am assured that my gold will be returned with the rental thereon, for the loan is based onproperty.

"Youth is ambitious. Youth would take shortcuts to wealth and the desirable things for which it stands. To secure wealth quickly youth oftenborrows unwisely. Youth, never having had experience, cannot realize that hopeless debt is like a deep pit intowhich one may descend quickly and where one may struggle vainly for many days. It is a pit of sorrowand regrets where the brightness of the sun is overcast and night is made unhappy by restless sleeping.Yet, I do not discourage borrowing gold. I encourage it. I recommend it if it be for a wise purpose.
