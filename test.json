Such\n            companies were legally independent of the people who set them up, or invested money in them, or managed\n            them. Over the last few centuries such companies have become the main players in the economic arena, and we\n            have grown so used to them that we forget they exist only in our imagination. In the US, the technical term\n            for a limited liability company is a ‘corporation’, which is ironic, because the term derives from ‘corpus’\n            (‘ body’ in Latin)– the one thing these corporations lack. Despite their having no real bodies, the American\n            legal system treats corporations as legal persons, as if they were flesh- and- blood human beings.",

When in 1896\n            Armand Peugeot wanted to create his company, he paid a lawyer to go through all these sacred procedures.\n            Once the lawyer had performed all the right rituals and pronounced all the necessary spells and oaths,\n            millions of upright French citizens behaved as if the Peugeot company really existed. Telling effective\n            stories is not easy. The difficulty lies not in telling the story, but in convincing everyone else to\n            believe it. Much of history revolves around this question: how does one convince millions of people to\n            believe particular stories about gods, or nations, or limited liability companies? Yet when it succeeds, it\n            gives Sapiens immense power, because it enables millions of strangers to cooperate and work towards common\n            goals. Just try to imagine how difficult it would have been to create states, or churches, or legal systems\n            if we could speak only about things that really exist, such as rivers, trees and lions.",

The more\n            profits he has, the more assistants he can employ. It follows that an increase in the profits of private\n            entrepreneurs is the basis for the increase in collective wealth and prosperity. This may not strike you as\n            very original, because we all live in a capitalist world that takes Smith’s argument for granted. We hear\n            variations on this theme every day in the news. Yet Smith’s claim that the selfish human urge to increase\n            private profits is the basis for collective wealth is one of the most revolutionary ideas in human history–\n            revolutionary not just from an economic perspective, but even more so from a moral and political\n            perspective.

The economic pie of 2014 is far larger than the pie of 1500,\n            but it is distributed so unevenly that many African peasants and Indonesian labourers return home after a\n            hard day’s work with less food than did their ancestors 500 years ago. Much like the Agricultural\n            Revolution, so too the growth of the modern economy might turn out to be a colossal fraud. The human species\n            and the global economy may well keep growing, but many more individuals may live in hunger and want.\n            Capitalism has two answers to this criticism. First, capitalism has created a world that nobody but a\n            capitalist is capable of running. The only serious attempt to manage the world differently– Communism– was\n            so much worse in almost every conceivable way that nobody has the stomach to try again. In 8500 BC one could\n            cry bitter tears over the Agricultural Revolution, but it was too late to give up agriculture. Similarly, we\n            may not like capitalism, but we cannot live without it. The second answer is that we just need more\n            patience– paradise, the capitalists promise, is right around the corner. True, mistakes have been made, such\n            as the Atlantic slave trade and the exploitation of the European working class. But we have learned our\n            lesson, and if we just wait a little longer and allow the pie to grow a little bigger, everybody will\n            receive a fatter slice. The division of spoils will never be equitable, but there will be enough to satisfy\n            every man, woman and child– even in the Congo.",

Happiness, according to this view, is something I feel inside myself, a sense of\n            either immediate pleasure or long- term contentment with the way my life is going. If it’s something felt\n            inside, how can it be measured from outside? Presumably, we can do so by asking people to tell us how they\n            feel. So psychologists or biologists who want to assess how happy people feel give them questionnaires to\n            fill out and tally the results.",

People who are diagnosed with chronic illness such as diabetes are usually depressed\n            for a while, but if the illness does not get worse they adjust to their new condition and rate their\n            happiness as highly as healthy people do.",

People with strong\n            families who live in tight- knit and supportive communities are significantly happier than people whose\n            families are dysfunctional and who have never found (or never sought) a community to be part of. Marriage is\n            particularly important. Repeated studies have found that there is a very close correlation between good\n            marriages and high subjective well- being, and between bad marriages and misery. This holds true\n            irrespective of economic or even physical conditions. An impecunious invalid surrounded by a loving spouse,\n            a devoted family and a warm community may well feel better than an alienated billionaire, provided that the\n            invalid’s poverty is not too severe and that his illness is not degenerative or painful.",

If you\n            want a brand- new Ferrari and get only a second- hand Fiat you feel deprived. This is why winning the\n            lottery has, over time, the same impact on people’s happiness as a debilitating car accident. When things\n            improve, expectations balloon, and consequently even dramatic improvements in objective conditions can leave\n            us dissatisfied.",
